       "'Statistical Tests for Optimization Efficiency..Levi Boyles, Anoop Korattikara, Deva Ramanan, Max Welling.Department of Computer Science.University of California, Irvine.Irvine, CA 92697-3425.{lboyles},{akoratti},{dramanan},{welling}@ics.uci.edu..Abstract.Learning problems, such as logistic regression, are typically formulated as pure.optimization problems defined on some loss function. We argue that this view.ignores the fact that the loss function depends on stochastically generated data.which in turn determines an intrinsic scale of precision for statistical estimation..By considering the statistical properties of the update variables used during the.optimization (e.g. gradients), we can construct frequentist hypothesis tests to.determine the reliability of these updates. We utilize subsets of the data for computing updates, and use the hypothesis tests for determining when the batch-size.needs to be increased. This provides computational benefits and avoids overfitting.by stopping when the batch-size has become equal to size of the full dataset..Moreover, the proposed algorithms depend on a single interpretable parameter ?.the probability for an update to be in the wrong direction ? which is set to a single.value across all algorithms and datasets. In this paper, we illustrate these ideas.on three L1 regularized coordinate descent algorithms: L1 -regularized L2 -loss.SVMs, L1 -regularized logistic regression, and the Lasso, but we emphasize that.the underlying methods are much more generally applicable...1..Introduction..There is an increasing tendency to consider machine learning as a problem in optimization: define.a loss function, add constraints and/or regularizers and formulate it as a preferably convex program..Then, solve this program using some of the impressive tools from the optimization literature. The.main purpose of this paper is to point out that this ?reduction to optimization? ignores certain.important statistical features that are unique to statistical estimation. The most important feature.we will exploit is the fact that the statistical properties of an estimation problem determine an.intrinsic scale of precision (that is usually much larger than machine precision). This implies.immediately that optimizing parameter-values beyond that scale is pointless and may even have an.adverse affect on generalization when the underlying model is complex. Besides a natural stopping.criterion it also leads to much faster optimization before we reach that scale by realizing that far.away from optimality we need much less precision to determine a parameter update than when.close to optimality. These observations can be incorporated in many off-the-shelves optimizers and.are often orthogonal to speed-up tricks in the optimization toolbox..The intricate relationship between computation and estimation has been pointed out before in [1].and [2] where asymptotic learning rates were provided. One of the important conclusions was.that a not so impressive optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can be.nevertheless a very good learning algorithm because it can process more data per unit time. Also.in [3] (sec. 5.5) the intimate relationship between computation and model fitting is pointed out..[4] gives bounds on the generalization risk for online algorithms, and [5] shows how additional.data can be used to reduce running time for a fixed target generalization error. Regret-minimizing.algorithms ([6], [7]) are another way to account for the interplay between learning and computation..Hypothesis testing has been exploited for computational gains before in [8]..1...Our method exploits the fact that loss functions are random variables subject to uncertainty. In a.frequentist world we may ask how different the value of the loss would have been if we would have.sampled another dataset of the same size from a single shared underlying distribution. The role of.an optimization algorithm is then to propose parameter updates that will be accepted or rejected.on statistical grounds. The test we propose determines whether the direction of a parameter update.is correct with high probability. If we do not pass our tests when using all the available data-cases.then we stop learning (or alternatively we switch to sampling or bagging), because we have reached.the intrinsic scale of precision set by the statistical properties of the estimation problem..However, we can use the same tests to speed up the optimization process itself, that is before we.reach the above stopping criterion. To see that, imagine one is faced with an infinite dataset. In batch.mode, using the whole (infinite) dataset, one would not take a single optimization step in finite time..Thus, one should really be concerned with making as much progress as possible per computational.unit. Hence, one should only use a subset of the total available dataset. Importantly, the optimal.batch-size depends on where we are in the learning process: far away from convergence we only.need a rough idea of where to move which requires very few data-cases. On the other hand, the.closer we get to the true parameter value, the more resolution we need. Thus, the computationally.optimal batch-size is a function of the residual estimation error. Our algorithm adaptively grows a.subset of the data by requiring that we have just enough precision to confidently move in the correct.direction. Again, when we have exhausted all our data we stop learning..Our algorithm heavily relies on the central limit tendencies of large sums of random variables..Fortunately, many optimization algorithms are based on averages over data-cases. For instance,.gradient descent falls in this class, as the gradient is defined by an average (or sum). As in [11],.with large enough batch sizes we can use the Central Limit Theorem to claim that the average.gradients are normally distributed and estimate their variance without actually seeing more data.(this assumption is empirically verified in section 5.2). We have furthermore implemented methods.to avoid testing updates for parameters which are likely to fail their test. This ensures that we.approximately visit the features with their correct frequency (i.e. important features may require.more updates than unimportant ones)..In summary, the main contribution of this paper is to introduce a class of algorithms with the.following properties..? They depend on a single interpretable parameter ? ? the probability to update parameters in the.wrong direction. Moreover, the performance of the algorithms is relatively insensitive to the.exact value we choose..? They have a natural, inbuilt stopping criterion. The algorithms terminate when the probability to.update the parameters in the wrong direction can not be made smaller than ?..? They are applicable to wide range of loss functions. The only requirement is that the updates.depend on sums of random variables..? They inherit the convergence guarantees of the optimization method under consideration. This.follows because the algorithms will eventually consider all the data..? They achieve very significant speedups in learning models from data. Throughout the learning.process they determine the size of the data subset required to perform updates that move in the.correct direction with probability at least 1 ? ?..We emphasize that our framework is generally applicable. In this paper we show how these considerations can be applied to L1 -regularized coordinate descent algorithms: L1 -regularized L2 -loss.SVMs, L1 -regularized logistic regression, and Lasso [9]. Coordinate descent algorithms are convenient because they do not require any tuning of hyper-parameters to be effective, and are still efficient.when training sparse models. Our methodology extends these algorithms to be competitive for dense.models and for N >> p. In section 2 we review the coordinate descent algorithms. Then, in section.3.2 we formulate our hypothesis testing framework, followed by a heuristic for predicting hypothesis.test failures in section 4. We report experimental results in section 5 and we end with conclusions...2..Coordinate Descent..We consider L1-regularized learning problems where the loss is defined as a statistical average over.N datapoints:.f (?) = ?||?||1 +..N.1 X.loss(?, xi , yi ).2N i=1..where..?, xi ?

To solve.where Lj (d; ?) = 2N.i=1 loss(? + dej , xi , yi ) and ej is the j.the above, we perform a second-order Taylor expansion of the partial loss Lj (d; ?):.1.f (? + dej ) ? |?j + d| + L?j (0; ?)d + L??j (0; ?)d2 + const.2.[10] show that the minimum of the approximate objective (3) is obtained with:.? ?.Lj (0,?)+?.?.if L?j (0, ?) + ? ?

For general convex loss functions,.one can optimize (2) by repeatedly linearizing and applying the above update. We perform a single.update per parameter during the cyclic iteration over parameters. Notably, the partial derivatives.are functions of statistical averages computed over N training points. We show that one can use.frequentist hypothesis tests to elegantly manage the amount of data needed (N ) to reliably compute.these quantities..2.1..L1 -regularized L2 -loss SVM..Using a squared hinge-loss function in (1), we obtain a L1 -regularized L2 -loss SVM:.lossSV M = max(0, 1 ? yi ?

In [10], each parameter is updated until convergence, using a line-search for each.update, whereas we simply check that L?? term is not ill formed rather than performing a line search..2.2..L1 -regularized Logistic Regression..Using a log-loss function in (1), we obtain a L1 -regularized logistic regression model:.losslog = log(1 + e?yi ?..T..xi..)..(7)..Appendix G of [10] derive the corresponding partial derivatives:.L?j (0, ?) =.2.3..N.1 X.?xij.2N i=1 1 + eyi ?

We can use this expression P.as an estimator P.for ? from a.dataset {xi , yi }. The above update rule assumes standardized data ( N1 i xij = 0, N1 i x2ij = 1),.but it is straightforward to extend for the general case...3..Hypothesis Testing..Each update ?jnew = ?j + dj is computed using a statistical average over a batch of N training.points. We wish to estimate the reliability of an update as a function of N . To do so, we model.the current ? vector as a fixed constant and the N training points as random variables drawn.from an underlying joint density p(x, y). This also makes the proposed updates dj and ?jnew.random variables because they are functions of the training points. In the following we will make.an explicit distinction between random variables, e.g. ?jnew , dj , xij , yi and their instantiations,.??jnew , d?j , x.?ij , y?i . We would like to determine whether or not a particular update is statistically.justified. To this end, we use hypothesis tests where if there is high uncertainty in the direction of.the update, we say this update is not justified and the update is not performed. For example, if our.proposed update ??jnew is positive, we want to ensure that P (?jnew < 0) is small..3.1..Algorithm Overview..We propose a ?growing batch? algorithm for handling very large or infinite datasets: first we select.a very small subsample of the data of size Nb ? N , and optimize until the entire set of parameters.are failing their hypothesis tests (described in more detail below). We then query more data points.and include them in our batch, reducing the variance of our estimates and making it more likely that.they will pass their tests. We continue adding data to our batch until we are using the full dataset.of size N . Once all of the parameters are failing their hypothesis tests on the full batch of data,.we stop training. The reasoning behind this is, as argued in the introduction, that at this point we.do not have enough evidence for even determining the direction in which to update, which implies.that further optimization would result in overfitting. Thus, our algorithm behaves like a stochastic.online algorithm during early stages and like a batch algorithm during later stages, equipped with.a natural stopping condition..In our experiments, we increase the batch size Nb by a factor of 10 once all parameters fail their.hypothesis tests for a given batch. Values in the range 2-100 also worked well, however, we chose.10 as it works very well for our implementation..3.2..Lasso..For quadratic loss functions with standardized variables, we can directly analyze the densities of.dj , ?jnew . We accept an update if the sign of dj can be estimated with sufficient probability. Central.to our analysis is ?j (11), which is equivalent to ?jnew for the unregularized case ? = 0. We rewrite.it as:.N.1 X.(j).?j =.zij (?) where zij (?) = xij (yi ? y?i ).(12).N i=1.Because zij (?) are given by a fixed transformation of the iid training points, they themselves are iid..As N ? ?, we can appeal to the Central Limit Theorm and model ?j as distributed as a standard.Normal: ?j ? N (??j , ??j ), where ??j = E[zij ], ?i and ??2 j = N1 V ar(zij ) ?i. Empirical.justification of normality of these quantities is given in section 5.2. So, for any given ?j , we can.provide estimates.1 X.1 X.z?ij.V ar(zij ) ? ?z2?j =.(?.zij ? z?j )2.(13).E[zij ] ? z?j =.N i.N ?1 i.4...AP and Time responses to ?

(right ) Plot showing the behavior of our algorithm with respect to.?, using logistic regression on the INRIA dataset. ? = 0 corresponds to an algorithm which never updates, and.? = 0.5 corresponds to an algorithm which always updates (with no stopping criteria), so for these experiments.? was chosen in the range [.01, .49]. Error bars denote a single standard deviation..which in turn provide estimates for ??j and ??j . We next apply the soft threshold function S to ?j to.obtain ?jnew , a random variable whose pdf is a Gaussian which has a section of width 2? ?squashed?.to zero into a single point of probability mass, with the remaining density shifted towards zero by a.magnitude ?. This is illustrated in Figure 1. Our criterion for accepting an update is that it moves.towards the true solution with high probability. Let d?j be the realization of the random variable.dj = ?jnew ? ?j , computed from the sample batch of N training points. If d?j > 0, then we want.P (dj ? 0) to be small, and vice versa. Specifically, for d?j > 0, we want P (dj ? 0) < ?, where.? \\x10 ? ?(? +?) \\x11.?j.?? j.if ?j < 0.?? j.new.\\x10.\\x11.P (dj ? 0) = P (?j.? ?j ) =.(14).?j ?(??j ??).??.if ?j ? 0.??.j..where ?(?) denotes the cdf for the standard Normal. This distribution can be derived from its two.underlying Gaussians, one with mean ??j + ? and one with mean ??j ? ?. Similarly, one can.define an analgous test of P (dj ? 0) < ? for d?j < 0. These are the hypothesis test equations.for a single coordinate, so this test is performed once for each coordinate at its iteration in the.coordinate descent algorithm. If a coordinate update fails its test, then we assume that we do not.have enough evidence to perform an update on the coordinate, and do not update. Note that, since.we are potentially rejecting many updates, significant computation could be going to ?waste,? as we.are computing updates without using them. Methods to address this follow in section 4..3.3..Gradient-Based Hypothesis Tests..For general convex loss functions, it is difficult to construct a pdf for dj and ?jnew . Instead, we.can be estimated with sufficient.accept an update ?jnew if the sign of the partial derivative ?f??(?).j.reliability. Because f (?) may be nondifferentiable, we define ?j f (?) to be the set of 1D subgradients, or lower tangent planes, at ? along direction j. The minimal (in magnitude) subgradient gj ,.associated with the flatest lower tangent, is:.?.N.if ?j < 0.? ?j ? ?.1 X.if ?j > 0.g j = ?j + ?.where.?j = L?j (0, ?) =.zij.(15).?.N i=1.S(?j , ?) otherwise.x..ij.for log-loss..where zij (?) = ?2yi xij bi (?) for the squared hinge-loss and zij (?) =.T.1+eyi ? xi.Appealing to the same arguements as in Sec.3.2, one can show that ?j ? N (??j , ??j ) where ??j =.E[zij ], ?i and ??2 j = N1 V ar(zij ) ?i. Thus the pdf of subgradient g is a Normal shifted by ?sign(?j ).in the case where ?j 6= 0, or a Normal transformed by the function S(?j , ?) in the case ?j = 0...To formulate our hypothesis test, we write g?j as the realization of random variable gj , computed.from the batch of N training points. We want to take an update only if our update is in the correct.5...SVM Algorithm Comparison on the INRIA dataset..SVM Algorithm Comparison on the VOC dataset..0.65.CD?Full.CD?Hyp Test.vanilla CD.SGD.SGD?Regret..0.6..2..10..3..10.time (seconds)..4..10..0.3..0.7..0.28..0.6..Average Precision..0.7..Average Precision..Average Precision..0.75..0.55 1.10..Logistic Regression Algorithm Comparison on the INRIA Dataset.0.8..0.32..0.8..0.26.0.24.0.22.0.2..0.16 3.10..4..10.time (seconds)..0.4.0.3.CD?Hyp.

We employ a simple heuristic towards these.matters based on a few observations (where for simplified notation we drop the subscript j):.1. If the set of parameters that are updating remains constant between updates, then for a particular.coordinate, the change in the gradient from one iteration to the next is roughly constant. This is.an empirical observation..2. When close to the solution, ?? remains roughly constant..We employ a heuristic which is a complicated instance of a simple idea: if the value a(0) of.a variable of interest is changing at a constant rate r, we can predict its value at time t with.a(t) = a(0) + rt. In our case, we wish to predict when the gradient will have moved to a point.where the associated hypothesis test will pass..First, we will consider the unregularized case (? = 0), wherein g = ?. We wish to detect when.the gradient will result in the hypothesis test passing, that is, we want to find the values ?? ? ?.?,.where ?.? is a realization of the random variable ?, such that P (g ? 0) = ? or P (g ? 0) = ?. For.this purpose, we need to draw the distinction between an update which was taken, and one which.is proposed but for which the hypothesis test failed. Let the set of accepted updates be indexed by.t, as in g?t , and let the set of potential updates, after an accepted update at time t, be indexed by s,.as in g?t (s). Thus the algorithm described in the previous section will compute g?t (1)...?.gt (s? ) until.the hypothesis test passes for g?t (s? ), and we then set g?t+1 (0) = g?t (s? ), and perform an update to.? using g?t+1 (0). Ideally, we would prefer not to compute g?t (1)...?.gt (s? ? 1) at all, and instead only.compute the gradient when we know the hypothesis test will pass, s? iterations after the last accept..Given that we have some scheme from skipping k iterations, we estimate a ?velocity? at which.? t (s?k?1).. If, for instance, ?? > 0, we can compute the value.g?t (s) = ?.? t (s) changes: ?e ? ?? t (s)??.k+1.of ?.? at which the hypothesis test will pass, assuming ?? remains constant, by setting P (g ? 0|?? =.?pass ) = ?, and subsequently we can approximate the number of iterations to skip next1 :.?pass = ??? ??1 (?).1..kskip ?..?pass ? ?.? t (s).??..In practice we cap kskip at some maximum number of iterations (say 40)...6..(17)...4..10..x 10..SGD ? ?0=.5..SGD ? ?0=1..0.81..SGD ? ?0=1..8..SGD ? ?0=2..0.8..SGD ? ?0=2..SGD ? ?0=3..7.6..?=.4.?=.2.?=.05..5.4..?=.4.?=.2.?=.05..0.77.0.76.0.75..2..0.74..1..SGD ? ?0=5..0.78..3..0..SGD ? ?0=3..0.79..SGD ? ?0=5..Average Precision..Time (seconds)..0.82..SGD ? ?0=.5..9..0.73.0.8..0.9..0.96.?..0.99..0.999..0.72..0.8..0.9..0.96.?..0.99..0.999..Figure 3: Comparison of our Lasso algorithm against SGD across various hyper-parameter settings for the.exponential annealing schedule. Our algorithm is marked by the horizontal lines, with ? ? {0.05, 0.2, 0.4}..Note that all algorithms have very similar precision scores in the interval [0.75 ? 0.76]. For values of.? = {0.8, 0.9, 0.96, 0.99, 0.999}, SGD gives a good score, however, picking ?0 > 1 had an adverse effect on.the optimization speed. Our method converged faster then SGD with the best annealing schedule..The regularized case with ?j > 0 is equivalent to the unregularized case where g = ? + ?, and we.solve for the value of ? that will allow the test to pass via P (g ? 0|?? = ?pass ) = ?:.?pass = ??? ??1 (?) ? ?..(18)..Similarly, the case with ?j ? 0 is equivalent to the unregularized case where g = ? ? ?:.?pass = ??? ??1 (?) + ?. For the case where ?? < 0, we solve for P (g ? 0|?? = ?pass ) = ?..This gives ?pass = ??? ??1 (1 ? ?) + ? if ?j < 0 and ?pass = ??? ??1 (1 ? ?) ? ? otherwise..A similar heuristic for the Lasso case can also be derived..4.1..Shrinking Strategy..It is common in SVM algorithms to employ a ?shrinking? strategy in which datapoints which do.not contribute to the loss are removed from future computations. Specifically, if a data point (xi , yi ).has the property that bi = 1 ? yi ? T xi < ?shrink < 0, for some ?shrink , then the data point is.removed from the current batch. Data points removed from earlier batches in the optimization.are still candidates for future batches. We employ this heuristic in our SVM implementation, and.Figure 2 shows the relative performance between including this heuristic and not...5.5.1..Experiments.Datasets..We provide experimental results for the task of visual object detection, building on recent successful.approaches that learn linear scanning-window classifiers defined on Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptors [12, 13]. We train and evaluate a pedestrain detector using the INRIA dataset.[12], where (N , p) = (5e6, 1100). We also train and evaluate a car detector using the 2007 PASCAL.VOC dataset [13], where (N ,p) = (6e7,1400). For both datasets, we measure performance using the.standard PASCAL evaluation protocol of average precision (with 50% overlap of predicted/ground.truth bounding boxes). On such large training sets, one would expect delicately-tuned stochastic.online algorithms (such as SGD) to outperform standard batch optimization (such as coordinate descent). We show that our algorithm exhibits the speed of the former with the reliability of the latter..5.2..Normality Tests..In this section we empirically verify the normality claims on the INRIA dataset. Because the.negative examples in this data are comprised of many overlapping windows from images, we.may expect this non-iid property to damage any normality properties of our updates. For these.experiments, we focus on the gradients of the L1 -regularized, L2 -loss SVM computed during.various stages of the optimization process. Figure 1 shows quantile-quantile plots of the average.gradient, computed over different subsamples of the data of fixed size Nb , versus the standard.Normal. Experiments for smaller N (? 100) and random ? give similar curves. We conclude that.the presence of straight lines provide strong evidence for our assumption that the distribution of.gradients is in fact close to normally distributed..7...5.3..Algorithm Comparisons..We compared our algorithm to the stochastic gradient method for L1 -regularized Log-linear models.in [14], adapted for the L1 -regularized methods above. We use the following decay schedule for.all curves over time labeled ?SGD?: ? = ?0 t01+t . In addition to this schedule, we also tested.against SGD using the regret-minimizing schedule of [6] on the INRIA dataset: ? = ?0 ?t10 +t ..After spending a significant amount of time hand-optimizing the hyper-parameters ?0 , t0 , we found.that settings ?0 ? 1 for both rate schedules, and t0 ? N/10 (standard SGD) and t0 ? (N/10)2.(regret-minimzing SGD) have worked well on our datasets. We ran all our algorithms ? Lasso,.Logistic Regression and SVM ? with a value of ? = 0.05 for both INRIA and VOC datasets..Figures 2 show a comparison between our method and stochastic gradient descent on the INRIA and.VOC datasets. Our method including the shrinking strategy is faster for the SVM, while methods.without a data shrinking strategy, such as logistic regression, are still competitive (see Figure 2)..In comparing our methods to the coordinate descent upon which ours are based, we see that our.framework provides a considerable speedup over standard coordinate descent. We do this with a.method which eventually uses the entire batch of data, so the tricks that enable SGD to converge in.an L1 -regularized problem are not necessary. In terms of performance, our models are equivalent.or near to published state of the art results for linear models [13, 15]..We also performed a comparison against SGD with an exponential decay schedule ? = ?0 e??t on.the Lasso problem (see Fig 3). Exponential decay schedules are known to work well in practice.[14], but do not give the theoretical convergence guarantees of other schedules. For a range of.values for ?0 and ?, we compare SGD against our algorithm with ? ? {0.05, 0.2, 0.4}. From these.experiments we conclude that changing ? from its standard value 0.05 all the way to 0.4 (recall.that ? < 0.5) has very little effect on accuracy and speed. This in contrast to SGD which required.hyper-parameter tuning to achieve comparable performance..To further demonstrate the robustness of our method to ?, we performed 5 trials of logistic regression.on the INRIA dataset with a wide range of values of ?, with random initializations, shown in Figure.1. All choices of ? give a reasonable average precision, and the algorithm begins to become.significantly slower only with ? > .3...6..Conclusions..We have introduced a new framework for optimization problems from a statistical, frequentist point.of view. Every phase of the learning process has its own optimal batchsize. That is to say, we.need only few data-cases early on in learning but many data-cases close to convergence. In fact, we.argue that when we are using all of our data and cannot determine with statistical confidence that.our update is in the correct direction, we should stop learning to avoid overfitting. These ideas are.absent in the usual frequentist (a.k.a. maximum likelihood) and learning-theory approaches which.formulate learning as the optimization of some loss function. A meaningful smallest length scale.based on statistical considerations is present in Bayesian analysis through the notion of a posterior.distribution. However, the most common inference technique in that domain, MCMC sampling,.does not make use of the fact that less precision is needed during the first phases of learning (a.k.a..?burn-in?) because any accept/reject rule requires all data-cases to be seen. Hence, our approach.can be thought of as a middle ground that borrows from both learning philosophies..Our approach also leverages the fact that some features are more predictive than others, and may.deserve more attention during optimization. By predicting when updates will pass their statistical.tests, we can update each feature approximately with the correct frequency..The proposed algorithms feature a single variable that needs to be set. However, the variable has a.clear meaning ? the allowed probability that an update moves in the wrong direction. We have used.? = 0.05 in all our experiments to showcase the robustness of the method..Our method is not limited to L1 methods or linear models; our framework can be used on any.algorithm in which we take updates which are simple functions on averages over the data..Relative to vanilla coordinate descent, our algorithms can handle dense datasets with N >> p. Relative to SGD2 our method can be thought of as ?self-annealing? in the sense that it increases its precision by adaptively increasing the dataset size. The advantages over SGD are therefore that we avoid.tuning hyper-parameters of an annealing schedule and that we have an automated stopping criterion..2.Recent benchmarks [16] show that a properly tuned SGD solver is highly competitive for large-scale.problems [17]...8...References.[1] L.

Its hardware is based on our previously proposed.forward-inverse-relaxation neural network (Wada & Kawato, 1993)..Computationally, its optimization principle is the minimum torquechange criterion. Regarding the representation level, hard constraints.satisfied by a trajectory are represented as a set of via-points extracted.from a handwritten character. Accordingly, we propose a via-point.estimation algorithm that estimates via-points by repeating the.trajectory formation of a character and the via-point extraction from the.character. In experiments, good quantitative agreement is found.between human handwriting data and the trajectories generated by the.theory. Finally, we propose a recognition schema based on the.movement generation. We show a result in which the recognition.schema is applied to the handwritten character recognition and can be.extended to the phoneme timing estimation of natural speech...1 INTRODUCTION.In reaching movements, trajectory formation is an ill-posed problem because the hand.can move along an infinite number of possible trajectories from the starting to the target.point. However, humans move an arm between two targets along consistent one of an.>II..Present Address: Systems Lab., Kawasaki Steel Corporation,.Makuhari Techno Garden, 1-3.Nakase, Mihama-ku, Chiba 261, Japan..727...728..Wada, Koike, Vatikiotis-Bateson, and Kawato..infinite number of trajectories. Therefore, the brain should be able to compute a unique.solution by imposing an appropriate criterion to the ill-posed problem. Especially, a.smoothness performance index was intensively studied in this context..Flash & Hogan (1985) proposed a mathematical model, the minimum-jerk model. Their.model is based on the kinematics of movement, independent of the dynamics of the.musculoskeletal system. On the other hand, based on the idea that the objective function.must be related to dynamics, Uno, Kawato & Suzuki (1989) proposed the minimum.torque-change criterion which accounts for the desired trajectory determination. The.criterion is based on the theory that the trajectory of the human arm is determined so as to.minimize the time integral of the square of the rate of torque change. They proposed the.following quadratic measure of performance. Where -r j is the torque generated by the jth actuator of M actuators, and ljis the movement time..CT =..0)2 dt.rJo L( -d-r\\'.dt.\"..M..(1)..j=l..Handwriting production is an attractive subject in human motor control studies. In.cursive handwriting, a symbol must be transformed into a motor command stream. This.transformation process raises several questions. How can the central nervous system.(eNS) represent a character symbol for producing a handwritten letter? By what principle.can motor planning be made or a motor command be produced? In this paper we propose.a handwriting model whose computational theory and representation are the same as the.model in reaching movements. Our proposed computational model for cursive.handwriting is assumed to generate a trajectory that passes through many via-points. The.computational theory is based on the minimum torque-change criterion, and a.representation of a character is assumed to be expressed as a set of via-points extracted.from a handwritten character. In reaching movement, the boundary condition is given by.the visual information, such as the location of a cup, and the trajectory formation is based.on the minimum torque-change criterion, which is completely the same as the model of.handwriting (Fig. 1). However, it is quite difficult to determine the via-points in order to.reproduce a cursive handwritten character.

Hollerbach proposed a handwriting model based on.oscillation theory. The model basically used a vertical oscillator and a horizontal.oscillator. Morasso & Mussa-Ivaldi proposed a trajectory formation model using a spline.function, and realized a handwritten character using the formation model..Edleman & Flash (1987) proposed a handwriting model based on snap (fourth derivative.of position) minimization. The representation of a character was four basic strokes and a.handwritten character was regenerated by a combination of several strokes. However,.their model was different from their theory for reaching movement. Flash & Hogan.(1985) have proposed the minimum jerk criterion in the reaching movement...3..A HANDWRITING MODEL..3.1 Trajectory formation neural network:.Forward-Inverse Relaxation Model (FIRM).First, we explain the trajectory formation neural network. Because the dynamics of the.human arm are nonlinear, finding a unique trajectory based on the minimum torquechange criterion is a nonlinear optimization problem. Moreover, it is rather difficult..There are several criticisms of previous proposed neural networks based on the minimum.torque-change criterion: (1) their spatial representation of time, (2) back propagation is.essential, and (3) much time is required. Therefore, we have proposed a new neural.network, FIRM(Forward-Inverse Relaxation Model) for trajectory formation (Wada &.Kawato, 1993). This network can be implemented as a biologically plausible neural.network and resolve the above criticisms...3.2 Via-point estimation model.Edelman & Flash (1987) have pointed out the difficulty of finding the via-points in a.handwritten character. They have argued two points: (1) the number of via-points, (2) a.reason for the choice of every via-point locus. It is clear in approximation theory that a.character can be regenerated perfectly if the number of extracted via-pOints is large..Appropriate via-points can not be assigned according to a regular sampling rule if the.sample duration is constant and long. Therefore, there is an infinite number of.combinations of numbers and via-point positions in the problem of extracting via-points.from a given trajectory, and a unique solution can not be found if a trajectory reformation.theory is not identified. That is, it is an ill-posed problem..The algorithm for assigning the via-points finds the via-points by iteratively activating.both the trajectory formation module (FIRM) and the via-point extraction module (Fig..2). The trajectory formation module generates a trajectory based on the minimum torquechange criterion using the via-points which are extracted by the via-point extraction.module. The via-point extraction module assigns the via-points so as to minimize the.square error between the given trajectory and the trajectory generated by the trajectory.formation module. The via-point extraction algorithm will stop when the error between.the given trajectory and the trajectory generated from the extracted via-points reaches a.threshold...729...730..Wada, Koike, Vatikiotis-Bateson, and Kawato..Via-Points Extraction Module Minimum TorqueChange Trajectory..f\\'IM.o j~l((J1.(I) -9~ta(t)5dl..- - . .

Trajectory production in.the module is based on the minimum-jerk model (Flash & Hogan 1985) on a joint angle.space. which is equivalent to the minimum torque-change model when arm dynamics are.approximated as in the following dynamic equation:.\",i = [i Oi.(j= 1..... M).(2).where Ii and iji are the inertia of the link and the acceleration of the j-th joint angle..respectively..The algorithm for via-point extraction is illustrated in Fig. 3. The procedural sequence is.as follows:.(Step 1) A trajectory between a starting point and a final point is generated by using the.minimum torque-change principle of the linear dynamics model..(Step 2) The point with the maximum square error value between the given trajectory and.the generated trajectory is selected as a via-point candidate..(Step 3) If the maximum value of the square error is less than the preassigned threshold..the procedure described above is finished. If the maximum value of the square error is.greater than the threshold. the via-point candidate is assigned as via-point i and a.trajectory is generated from the starting point through the via-point i to the final point..This generated trajectory is added to the trajectory that has already been generated. The.time of the start point of the generated trajectory is a via-point located just before the.assigned via-point i. and the time of the final point of the generated trajectory is a viapoint located just after the assigned via-point i. The position error of the start point and.the final point equal O. since the compensation for the error has already been made. Thus,.the boundary conditions of the generated trajectory at the start and final point become O..The velocity and acceleration constraints at the start and final point are set to O..(Step 4) By repeating Steps 2 and 3, a set of via-points is found..The j-th actuator velocity constraint 9!ia and acceleration constraint O!ia at the via-point i.are set by minimizing the following equation...J(8!ia,O~a) [p{ J,r:!\" (lP)2 dt + J,r:}...

This trajectory and the given trajectory are then compared again. If the value.of the square error does not reach the threshold, the procedure above is repeated..It can be mathematically shown that a given trajectory is perfectly approximated with this.method (completeness), and furthermore that the number of extracted via-points for a.threshold is the minimum (optimality). (Wada & Kawato, 1994)..4 PERFORMANCE OF THE VIA-POINT ESTIMATION MODEL.4.1 Performance of single via-point movement.First, we examine the performance of our proposed via-point estimation model. A result.of via-point estimation in a movement with a via-point is shown in Fig 4. Two.movements (T3-PI-T5 and T3-P2-T5) are examined. The white circle and the solid lines.show the target points and measured trajectories, respectively. PI and P2 show target.via-points. The black circle shows the via-points estimated by the algorithm. The.estimated via-points were close to the target via-points.

The via-point estimation algorithm extracts a viapoint (segmentation point) between characters..velocity profile. The via-points of the other group are assigned to positions that are.independent of the above points. Generally, the minimums of the velocity are considered.to be the feature points of the movement. However, we confirmed that a given trajectory.can not be reproduced by using only the first group of via-points. This finding shows that.the second group of via-points is important. Our proposed algorithm based on the.minimization principle can estimate points that can not be selected by any kinematic.criterion. Funhermore, it is important in handwritten character recognition that the viapoint estimation algorithm extracts via-points between characters, that is, their.segmentation points...5..FROM FORMATION TO RECOGNITION..5.1 A recognition model.Next, we propose a recognition system using the trajectory formation model and the viapoint estimation model. There are several reports in the literature of psychology which.suggest that the formation process is related to the recognition process. (Liberman &.Mattingly, 1985; Freyd, 1983).Here, we present a pattern recognition model that strongly depends on the handwriting.model and the via-point estimation model (Fig.6). (1) The features of the handwritten.character are extracted by the via-point estimation algorithm. (2) Some of via-points are.segmented and normalized in space and time. Then, (3) a trajectory is regenerated by.using the normalized via-points. (4) A symbol is identified by comparing the regenerated.trajectory with the template trajectory........QJ..~..E..\\'\\'=.~..-E..5.:.o.~.c..\"\"\".IQ...!~..;>..Recognizer.~ (Reformation.& Comparison)..~Ymb\\'..Figure 6: Movement pattern recognition using extracted via-points obtained through.movement pattern generator...A Computational Model for Cursive Handwriting Based on the Minimization Principle..rItwz-..1 :BAD : (0,17) (18,35) (36,52).2 :BAD : (0,18) (18,35) (36,52).3 :BAD : (0,17) (18,35) (35,52).1 :DEAR : (0,8) (9,18) (19,31) (30,51).2 :DEAR : (0,8) (9,18) (19,31) (30,50).3 :DEAR : (0,8) (9,18) (19,30) (30,51)..Figure 7: Results of character recognition.5.2 Performance of the character recognition model.Fig. 7 shows a result of character recognition.

Rather good agreement is found between the.estimated via-points and the phonemes..From this experiment, we can point out two important possibilities for the estimation.model of phoneme timing. The first possibility concerns speech recognition, and the.second concerns speech data compression. It seems possible to extend the via-point.estimation algorithm to speech recognition if a mapping from acoustic to articulator.motion is identified (Shirai & Kobayashi, 1991, Papcun et al., 1992). Furthermore, with.training of a forward mapping from articulator motion to acoustic data (Hirayama et al.,.1993), the via-point estimation model can be used for speech data compression...6 SUMMARY.We have proposed a new handwriting model. In experiments, good qualitative and.quantitative agreement is found between human handwriting data and the trajectories.generated by the model. Our model is unique in that the same optimization principle and.hard constraints used for reaching are also used for cursive handwriting. Also, as.opposed to previous handwriting models, determination of via-points is based on the.optimization principle and does not use a priori knowledge..We have demonstrated two areas of recognition, connected cursive handwritten character.recognition and the estimation of phoneme timing. We incorporated the formation model.into the recognition model and realized the recognition model suggested by Freyd (1983).and Liberman and Mattingly(1985). The most important point shown by the models is.that the human recognition process can be realized by specifying the human formation.process...REFERENCES.S. Edelman & T.

We present a model.of the generation of the observed graph that includes degree-based.structure priors on the hidden graphs. Exact inference in the model.is intractable; we present an efficient approximate inference algorithm to compute edge appearance posteriors. We evaluate our.model and algorithm on a biological graph inference problem...1..Introduction and motivation..The inference of hidden graphs from noisy edge appearance data is an important.problem with obvious practical application. For example, biologists are currently.building networks of all the physical protein-protein interactions (PPI) that occur.in particular organisms. The importance of this enterprise is commensurate with its.scale: a completed network would be as valuable as a completed genome sequence,.and because each organism contains thousands of different types of proteins, there.are millions of possible types of interactions. However, scalable experimental methods for detecting interactions are noisy, generating many false detections. Motivated.by this application, we formulate the general problem of inferring hidden graphs as.probabilistic inference in a graphical model, and we introduce an efficient algorithm.that approximates the posterior probability that an edge is present..In our model, a set of hidden, constituent graphs are combined to generate the observed graph. Each hidden graph is independently sampled from a prior on graph.structure. The combination mechanism acts independently on each edge but can.be either stochastic or deterministic. Figure 1 shows an example of our generative.model. Typically one of the hidden graphs represents the graph of interest (the true.graph), the others represent different types of observation noise. Independent edge.noise may also be added by the combination mechanism. We use probabilistic inference to compute a likely decomposition of the observed graph into its constituent.parts. This process is deemed ?untangling?. We use the term ?denoising? to refer.to the special case where the edge noise is independent. In denoising there is a.single hidden graph, the true graph, and all edge noise in the observed graph is due...E1.eij1..E2..i..eij2..j..xij..i..j..i..j..X..Figure 1: Illustrative generative model example. Figure shows an example where an observed.graph, X, is a noisy composition of two constituent graphs, E 1 and E 2 . All graphs share the.same vertex set, so each can be represented by a symmetric matrix of random binary variables.(i.e., an adjacency matrix). This generative model is designed to solve a toy counter-espionage.problem. The vertices represent suspects and each edge in X represents an observed call.between two suspects. The graph X reflects zero or more spy rings (represented by E 1 ),.telemarketing calls (represented by E 2 ), social calls (independent edge noise), and lost call.records (more independent edge noise). The task is to locate any spy rings hidden in X. We.model the distribution of spy ring graphs using a prior, P (E 1 ), that has support only on graphs.where all vertices have degree of either 2 (i.e., are in the ring) or 0 (i.e., are not). Graphs of.telemarketing call patterns are represented using a prior, P (E 2 ), under which all nodes have.degrees of > 3 (i.e., are telemarketers), 1 (i.e., are telemarketees), or 0 (i.e., are neither). The.displayed hidden graphs are one likely untangling of X...to the combination mechanism..Prior distributions over graphs can be specified in various ways, but our choice is.motivated by problems we want to solve, and by a view to deriving an efficient inference algorithm. One compact representation of a distribution over graphs consists.of specifying a distribution over vertex degrees, and assuming that graphs that have.the same vertex degrees are equiprobable. Such a prior can model quite rich distributions over graphs. These degree-based structure priors are natural representions.of graph structure; many classes of real-world networks have a characteristic functional form associated with their degree distributions [1], and sometimes this form.can be predicted using knowledge about the domain (see, e.g., [2]) or detected empirically (see, e.g., [3, 4]). As such, our model incorporates degree-based structure.priors..Though exact inference in our model is intractable in general, we present an efficient.algorithm for approximate inference for arbitrary degree distributions. We evaluate.our model and algorithm using the real-world example of untangling yeast proteinprotein interaction networks....2..A model of noisy and tangled graphs..For degree-based structure priors, inference consists of searching over vertex degrees.and edge instantiations, while comparing each edge with its noisy observation and.enforcing the constraint that the number of edges connected to every vertex must.equal the degree of the vertex. Our formulation of the problem in this way is inspired by the success of the sum-product algorithm (loopy belief propagation) for.solving similar formulations of problems in error-correcting decoding [6, 7], phase.unwrapping [8], and random satisfiability [9]. For example, in error-correcting decoding, inference consists of searching over configurations of codeword bits, while.comparing each bit with its noisy observation and enforcing parity-check constraints.on subsets of bits [10]..For a graph on a set of N vertices, eij is a variable that indicates the presence.of an edge connecting vertices i and j: eij = 1 if there is an edge, and eij = 0.otherwise. We assume the vertex set is fixed, so each graph is specified by an.adjacency matrix, E = {eij }N.i,j=1 . The degree of vertex i is denoted by di and the.degree set by D = {di }N...The.observations are given by a noisy adjacency matrix,.i=1.X = {xij }N...Generally,.edges.can be directed, but in this paper we focus on.i,j=1.undirected graphs, so eij = eji and xij = xji ..Assuming the observation noise is independent for different edges, the joint distribution is.P (X, E, D) = P (X|E)P (E, D) =..?Y.j?i..?.P (xij |eij ) P (E, D)...P (xij |eij ) models the edge observation noise. We use an undirected model for the.joint distribution over edges and degrees, P (E, D), where the prior distribution over.di is determined by a non-negative potential fi (di ). Assuming graphs that have the.same vertex degrees are equiprobable, we have..P (E, D) ?..Y?.i..fi (di )I(di ,..N.X.j=1..?.eij ) ,..P.where I(a, b) = 1 if a = b, and I(a, b) = 0 if a 6= b. The term I(di , j eij ).ensures that the number of edges connected to vertex i is equal to di . It.is straightforward.? Q to show ?that the marginal distribution over di is P (di ) ?.P.fi (di ) D\\\\di nD j6=i fj (dj ) , where nD is the number of graphs with degrees D.and the sum is over all degree variables except di . The potentials, fi , can be.estimated from a given degree prior using Markov chain Monte Carlo; or, as an.approximation, they can be set to an empirical degree distribution obtained from.noise-free graphs..Fig 2a shows the factor graph [11] for the above model. Each filled square corresponds to a term in the factorization of the joint distribution and the square is.connected to all variables on which the term depends. Factor graphs are graphical.models that unify the properties of Bayesian networks and Markov random fields.[12]. Many inference algorithms, including the sum-product algorithm (a.k.a. loopy.belief propagation), are more easily derived using factor graphs than Bayesian networks or Markov random fields. We describe the sum-product algorithm for our.model in section 3....(a)..I(d ,e + e +e +e.4 14 24 34..44..d1..e11..e12..e14..4..d3..d2..e13..f 4(d )..e22..e23..e24..(b)..)..d1..d4..e33..e34..e1..e44..11..x11.x11..x12..x13..x14..x22..x23..x24..x33..d1..1..x34..x44..e2.11..e1..12..x12.e2.12..d1..2..e1..13..e1..e2.13..e1..14..x13..e1..22..x14.e2.14..d1..3..23..x22.e2.22..x23.e2.23..4..e1..e1..24..e2.24..e1..33..x24..34..x33.e2.33..x34.e2.34..e1..44..x44.e2.44..P( x44 | e44 ).(c).d4..s41.e14..e24..d2.1..d4..e34..e44..e14..s42..e24..s43..e34..d2.2..d2.3..d2.4..s44.P( x..e44..44..1.,e 2 ).44 44..|e..Figure 2: (a) A factor graph that describes a distribution over graphs with vertex degrees.di , binary.P edge indicator variables eij , and noisy edge observations xij .

A more challenging.goal, with practical application, is to infer multiple hidden graphs that combine to.explain the observed edge data. In section 4, we show how priors over multiple.hidden graphs can be be used to infer protein-protein interactions..When there are H hidden graphs, each constituent graph is specified by a set of.edges on the same set of N common vertices. For the degree variables and edge.variables, we use a superscript to indicate which hidden graph the variable is used.to describe. Assuming the graphs are independent, the joint distribution over the.observed edge data X, and the edge variables and degree variables for the hidden.graphs, E 1 , D1 , . . . , E H , DH , is.P (X, E 1 , D1 , . . . , E H , DH ) =..?Y.j?i..P (xij |e1ij , . . . , eH.ij )..H.?Y..P (E h , Dh ),..(1)..h=1..where for each hidden graph, P (E h , Dh ) is modeled as described above. Here, the.likelihood P (xij |e1ij , . . . , eH.ij ) describes how the edges in the hidden graphs combine.to model the observed edge. Figure 2b shows the factor graph for this model...3..Probabilistic inference of constituent graphs..Exact probabilistic inference in the above models is intractable, here we introduce.an approximate inference algorithm that consists of applying the sum-product algorithm, while ignoring cycles in the factor graph. Although the sum-product algorithm has been used to obtain excellent results on several problems [6, 7, 13, 14, 8, 9],.we have found that the algorithm works best when the model consists of uncertain.observations of variables that are subject to a large number of hard constraints..Thus the formulation of the model described above....Conceptually, our inference algorithm is a straight-forward application of the sumproduct algorithm, c.f. [15], where messages are passed along edges in the factor.graph iteratively, and then combined at variables to obtain estimates of posterior.probabilities. However, direct implementation of the message-passing updates will.lead to an intractable algorithm. In particular,.direct implementation of the update.P.for the message sent from function I(di , j eij ) to edge variable eik takes a number.of scalar operations that is exponential in the number of vertices. Fortunately there.exists a more efficient way to compute these messages..3.1..Efficiently summing over edge configurations.P.The function I(di , j eij ) ensures that the number of edges connected to vertex i.is equal to di . Passing messages through this function requires summing over all.edge configurations that correspond to each possible degree, di , andPsumming over.di . Specifically, the message, ?Ii ?eik (eik ), sent from function I(di , j eij ) to edge.variable eik is given by.?.?.X.X.X.Y.I(di ,.eij ).?eij ?Ii (eij ) ,.di {eij | j=1,...,N, j6=k}..j..j6=k..where ?eij ?Ii (eij ) is the message sent from eij to function I(di ,..P..j..eij )...The sum over {eij | j = 1, . . . , N, j 6= k} contains 2N ?1 terms, so direct computation.is intractable. However,.Pfor a maximum degree of dmax , all messages departing.from the function I(di , j eij ) can be computed using order dmax N binary scalar.P.operations, by introducing integer state variables sij . We define sij = n?j ein.and note that, by recursion, sij = sij?1 + eij , where si0 = 0 and 0 ? sij ? dmax ..This recursive expression enables us to write the high-complexity constraint as the.sum of a product of low-complexity constraints,.N.?Y.?.X.X.I(di ,.eij ) =.I(si1 , ei1 ).I(sij , sij?1 + eij ) I(di , siN )..j..{sij | j=1,...,N }..j=2..This summation can be performed using the forward-backward algorithm. In.the factor.graph, the summation can be implemented by replacing the function.P.I(di , j eij ) with a chain of lower-complexity functions, connected as shown in Fig..2c. The function vertex (filled square) on the far left corresponds to I(si1 , ei1 ) and.the function vertex in the upper right corresponds.P to I(di , siN ). So, messages can.be passed through each constraint function I(di , j eij ) in an efficient manner, by.performing a single forward-backward pass in the corresponding chain...4..Results..We evaluate our model using yeast protein-protein interaction (PPI) data compiled.by [16]. These data include eight sets of putative, but noisy, interactions derived.from various sources, and one gold-standard set of interactions detected by reliable.experiments..Using the ? 6300 yeast proteins as vertices, we represent the eight sets of putative.m.interactions using adjacency matrices {Y m }8m=1 where yij.= 1 if and only if putative.interaction dataset m contains an interaction between proteins i and j. We similarly.use Y gold to represent the gold-standard interactions..m.We construct an observed graph, X, by setting xij = maxm yij.for all i and j, thus.the observed edge set is the union of all the putative edge sets.

The training set contains a randomly selected half of the.? 6300 yeast proteins, and the subgraphs of E 1 , E 2 , and X restricted to those.vertices. The test contains the other half of the proteins and the corresponding.subgraphs. Note that interactions connecting test set proteins to training set proteins (and vice versa) are ignored..We fit three sets of parameters: a set of Naive Bayes parameters that define a set of.edge-specific likelihood functions, Pij (xij |e1ij , e2ij ), one degree potential, f 1 , which.is the same for every vertex in E1 and defines the prior P (E 1 ), and a second, f 2 ,.that similarly defines the prior P (E 2 )..The likelihood functions, Pij , are used to both assign likelihoods and enforce problem constraints. Given our problem definition, if xij = 0 then e1ij = e2ij = 0,.otherwise xij = 1 and e1ij = 1 ? e2ij . We enforce the former constraint by setting Pij (xij = 0|e1ij , e2ij ) = (1 ? e1ij )(1 ? e2ij ), and the latter by setting Pij (xij =.1|e1ij , e2ij ) = 0 whenever e1ij = e2ij . This construction of Pij simplifies the calculation.of the ?Pij ?ehij messages and improves the computational efficiency of inference because when xij = 0, we need never update messages to and from variables e1ij and.e2ij . We complete the specification of Pij (xij = 1|e1ij , e2ij ) as follows:.( ym.m.?mij (1 ? ?m )1?yij , if e1ij = 1 and e2ij = 0,.1.2.Pij (xij = 1|eij , eij ) =.m.ym.?mij (1 ? ?m )1?yij , if e1ij = 0 and e2ij = 1..P.P.m 1.where {?m } and {?m } are naive Bayes parameters, ?m = i,j yij.eij / i,j e1ij and...?m =..P..i,j..m 2.yij.eij /..P..i,j..e2ij , respectively...The degree potentials f 1 (d) and f 2 (d) are kernel density estimates fit to the degree.distribution of the training set subgraphs of E 1 and E 2 , respectively. We use.Gaussian kernels and set the width parameter (standard deviation) ? using leaveone-out cross-validation to maximize the total log density of the held-out datapoints..Each datapoint is the degree of a single vertex. Both degree potentials closely.followed the training set empirical degree distributions..Untangling was done on the test set subgraph of X. We initially set the ? Pij ?e1ij.messages equal to the likelihood function Pij and we randomly initialized the.?Ij1 ?e1ij messages with samples from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 0.01. We then performed 40 iterations of the following message update order:.?e1ij ?Ij1 , ?Ij1 ?e1ij , ?e1ij ?Pij , ?Pij ?e2ij , ?e2ij ?Ij2 , ?Ij2 ?e2ij , ?e2ij ?Pij , ?Pij ?e1ij ..We evaluated our untangling algorithm using an ROC curve by comparing the actual.test set subgraph of E 1 to posterior marginal probabilities,P? (e1ij = 1|X), estimated.by our sum-product algorithm. Note that because the true interaction network is.sparse (less than 0.2% of the 1.8 ? 107 possible interactions are likely present [16]).and, in this case, true positive predictions are of greater biological interest than.true negative predictions, we focus on low false positive rate portions of the ROC.curve..Figure 3a compares the performance of a classifier for e1ij based on thresholding.P? (eij = 1|X) to a baseline method based on thresholding the likelihood functions,.Pij (xij = 1|e1ij = 1, e2ij = 0). Note because e1ij = 0 whenever xij = 0, we exclude.the xij = 0 cases from our performance evaluation. The ROC curve shows that.for the same low false positive rate, untangling produces 50% ? 100% more true.positives than the baseline method..Figure 3b shows that the degree potential, the true degree distribution, and the.predicted degree distribution are all comparable. The slight overprediction of the.true degree distribution may result because the degree potential f 1 that defines.P (E 1 ) is not equal to the expected degree distribution of graphs sampled from the.distribution P (E 1 )...5..Summary and Related Work..Related work includes other algorithms for structure-based graph denoising [17, 18]..These algorithms use structural properties of the observed graph to score edges and.rely on the true graph having a surprisingly large number of three (or four) edge.cycles compared to the noise graph. In contrast, we place graph generation in a.probabilistic framework; our algorithm computes structural fit in the hidden graph,.where this computation is not affected by the noise graph(s); and we allow for.multiple sources of observation noise, each with its own structural properties..After submitting this paper to the NIPS conference, we discovered [19], in which a.degree-based graph structure prior is used to denoise (but not untangle) observed.graphs. This paper addresses denoising in directed graphs as well as undirected.graphs, however, the prior that they use is not amenable to deriving an efficient sumproduct algorithm. Instead, they use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to do approximate.inference in a hidden graph containing 40 vertices. It is not clear how well this.approach scales to the ? 3000 vertex graphs that we are using..In summary, the contributions of the work described in this paper include: a general...formulation of the problem of graph untangling as inference in a factor graph; an.efficient approximate inference algorithm for a rich class of degree-based structure.priors; and a set of reliability scores (i.e., edge posteriors) for interactions from a.current version of the yeast protein-protein interaction network...References.[1] A L Barabasi and R Albert.

In particular,.using the multiclass formulation of boosting and SVM we note that both use.a combination of mapping and linear classification to maximize the multiclass.margin. In SVM this is implemented using a pre-defined mapping (induced by.the kernel) and optimizing the linear classifiers. In boosting the linear classifiers.are pre-defined and the mapping (predictor) is learned through combination of.weak learners. We argue that the intermediate mapping, e.g. boosting predictor, is.preserving the discriminant aspects of the data and by controlling the dimension of.this mapping it is possible to achieve discriminant low dimensional representations.for the data. We use the aforementioned duality and propose a new method, Large.Margin Discriminant Dimensionality Reduction (LADDER) that jointly learns the.mapping and the linear classifiers in an efficient manner. This leads to a data-driven.mapping which can embed data into any number of dimensions. Experimental.results show that this embedding can significantly improve performance on tasks.such as hashing and image/scene classification...1..Introduction..Boosting and support vector machines (SVM) are widely popular techniques for learning classifiers..While both methods are maximizing the margin, there are a number of differences that distinguish.them; e.g. while SVM selects a number of examples to assemble the decision boundary, boosting.achieves this by combining a set of weak learners..In this work we propose a new duality between boosting and SVM which follows from their multiclass.formulations. It shows that both methods seek a linear decision rule by maximizing the margin.after transforming input data to an intermediate space. In particular, kernel-SVM (K-SVM) [37].first selects a transformation (induced by the kernel) that maps data points into an intermediate.space, and then learns a set of linear decision boundaries that maximize the margin. This is depicted.in Figure 1-bottom. In contrast, multiclass boosting (MCBoost) [32] relies on a set of pre-defined.codewords in an intermediate space, and then learns a mapping to this space such that it maximizes the.margin with respect to the boundaries defined by those codewords. See Figure 1-top. Therefore, both.boosting and SVM follow a two-step procedure: (i) mapping data to some intermediate space, and.(ii) determine the boundaries that separate the classes. There are, however, two notable differences:.1) while K-SVM aims to learn only the boundaries, MCBoost effort is on learning the mapping and.1...2) in K-SVM the intermediate space typically has infinite dimensions, while in MCBoost the space.has M or M ? 1 dimensions, where M is the number of classes...Data..The intermediate space (called prediction space) in the exposed duality has some.interesting properties..In particular, the final classifier decision is based on the.representation of data points in this prediction space where the decision boundaries are linear..An accurate classification by these simple boundaries suggests.that the input data points must be very-well separated in this space. Given that in the case of.boosting this space has limited dimensions, e.g..M or M ? 1, this suggests that we can poten- MCBoost:.tially use the predictor of MCBoost as a discriminant dimensionality reduction operator. However, the dimension of MCBoost is either M or.select linear classifiers.learn a transformation.M ?1 which restricts application of this operator.as a general dimensionality reduction operator..In addition, according to the proposed duality,.each of K-SVM or Boosting optimizes only one.of the two components, i.e. mapping and decision boundaries. Because of this, extra care K-SVM: select a transformation.learn a linear classifier.needs to be put in manually choosing the right.kernel in K-SVM; and in MCBoost, we may Figure 1: Duality between multiclass boosting and.not even be able to learn a good mapping if we SVM..preset some bad boundaries..SVCL.We can potentially overcome these limitations by combining boosting.and SVM to jointly learn both.the mapping and linear classifiers for a prediction space of arbitrary dimension d. We note that this.is not a straightforward merge of the two methods as this can lead to a computationally prohibitive.method; e.g. imagine having to solve the quadratic optimization of K-SVM before each iteration of.boosting. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, Large-mArgin Discriminant DimEnsionality.Reduction (LADDER), to efficiently implement this hybrid approach using a boosting-like method..LADDER is able to learn both the mapping and the decision boundaries in a margin maximizing.objective function that is adjustable to any number of dimensions. Experiments show that the resulting.embedding can significantly improve tasks such as hashing and image/scene classification...Related works: This paper touches several topics such as dimensionality reduction, classification,.embedding and representation learning. Due to space constraints we present only a brief overview.and comparison to previous work..Dimensionality reduction has been studied extensively. Unsupervised techniques, such as principal.component analysis (PCA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), clustering, or deep autoencoders, are conceptually simple and easy to implement, but may eliminate discriminant dimensions.of the data and result in sub-optimal representations for classification. Discriminant methods, such as.sequential feature selection techniques [29], neighborhood components analysis [9], large margin.nearest neighbors [40] or maximally collapsing metric learning [35] can require extensive computation.and/or fail to guarantee large margin discriminant data representations..The idea of jointly optimizing the classifiers and the embedding has been extensively explored in.embedding and classification literature, e.g. [5, 39, 43, 41]. These methods, however, typically.rely on linear data transformation/classifier, requires more complex semi-definite programming [39].or rely on Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) approach [5, 43, 8] which has shown inferior.performance compared to direct multiclass boosting methods [32, 25]. In comparison, we note that.the proposed method (1) is able to learn a very non-linear transformation through boosting predictor,.e.g. boosting deep decision trees; and, (2) relies on direct multiclass boosting that optimizes a margin.enforcing loss function. Another example of jointly learning the classifiers and the embedding is.multiple kernel learning (MKL) literature, e.g. [10, 34]. In these methods, a new kernel is learned as.a linear combination of fixed basis functions. Compared with LADDER, 1) the basis functions are.data-driven and not fixed, and 2) our method is also able to combine weak learners and form novel.basis functions tailored for the current task. Finally, it is also possible to jointly learn the classifiers.and embedding using deep neural networks. This, however, requires large number of training data..2..64...Algorithm 1 MCBoost.Input: number of classes M , number of iterations Nb , predictor dimension, d, codewords {y 1 , . . . , y M } ?

This is formulated as the predictor f (x) that.minimizes the risk.1X.L(zi , f (xi )),.(1).L[f ] = EX,Z {L(z, f (x))} ?.n i.defined by a loss L(z, f (x)). Different algorithms vary in their choice of loss functions and numerical.optimization procedures. The learned predictor has large margin if the loss L(z, f (x)) encourages.large values of the classification margin. For binary classification, f (x) ? R, z ? {1, 2}, the margin.is defined as M(xi , zi ) = yi f (xi ), where yi = y(zi ) ? {?1, 1} is the codeword of class zi . The.classifier is then F (x) = H(sign[f (x)]) where H(+1) = 1 and H(?1) = 2..The extension to M-ary classification requires M codewords. These are defined in a multidimensional.space, i.e. as y k ? Rd , k = 1 . . . M where commonly d = M or d = M ? 1. The predictor is then.f (x) = [f1 (x), f2 (x) . . . fd (x)] ?

Hence, MC-KSVM minimizes the.risk L[f ] subject to a regularization constraint on l kwl k22 . The predictor of the multiclass kernel.SVM (MC-KSVM) is then defined as.FM C?KSV M (x) = arg max h?(x), wl? i..l=1..M..(10)..Duality: The discussion of the previous sections unveils an interesting duality between multiclass.boosting and SVM. Since (7) and (10) are special cases of (2) and (3), respectively, the MC-SVM is a.special case of the formulation of Section 2, with predictor f (x) = ?(x) and codewords y l = wl ..This leads to the duality of Figure 1. Both boosting and SVM implement a classifier with a set of.linear decision boundaries on a prediction space F. This prediction space is the range space of the.predictor f (x). The linear decision boundaries are the planes whose normals are the codewords.y l . For both boosting and SVM, the decision boundaries implement a large margin classifier in F..However, the learning procedure is different. For the SVM, examples are first mapped into F by a.pre-defined predictor. This is the feature transformation ?(x) that underlies the SVM kernel. The.codewords (linear classifiers) are then learned so as to maximize the margin. On the other hand, for.boosting, the codewords are pre-defined and the boosting algorithm learns the predictor f (x) that.maximizes the margin. The boosting / SVM duality is summarized in Table 1..4..3...Algorithm 3 LADDER.Input: number of classes M , dataset D = {(xi , zi )}ni=1 where zi ? {1 . . .

Many learning problems require dimensionality reduction. This.is usually done by mapping the space of features X to some lower dimensional space R, and then.learning a classifier on R. However, the mapping from X to R is usually quite difficult to learn..Unsupervised procedures, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or clustering, frequently.eliminate discriminant dimensions of the data that are important for classification. On the other hand,.supervised procedures tend to lead to complex optimization problems and can be quite difficult to.implement. Using the proposed duality we argue that it is possible to use an embedding provided.by boosting or SVM. In case of SVM this embedding is usually infinite dimensional which can.make it impractical for some applications, e.g. hashing problem [18]. In case of boosting the.embedding, f (x), has a finite dimension d. In general, the complexity of learning a predictor f (x).is inversely proportional to this dimension d, and lower dimensional codewords/predictors require.more sophisticated predictor learning. For example, convolutional networks such as [20] use the.canonical basis of RM as codeword set, and a predictor composed of M neural network outputs..This is a deep predictor, with multiple layers of feature transformation, using a combination of linear.and non-linear operations. Similarly, as discussed in the previous section, MCBoost can be used to.learn predictors of dimension M or M ? 1, by combining weak learners. A predictor learned by.any of these methods can be interpreted as a low-dimensional embedding. Compared to the classic.sequential approach of first learning an intermediate low dimensional space R and then learning.a predictor f : R ? F = RM , these methods learn the classifier directly in a low-dimensional.prediction space, i.e. F = R. In the case of boosting, this leverages a classifier that explicitly.maximizes the classification margin for the solution of the dimensionality reduction problem..The main limitation of this approach is that current multiclass boosting methods [32, 25] rely on a.fixed codeword dimension d, e.g. d = M in [25] or d = M ? 1 in [32]. In addition these codewords.are pre-defined and are independent of the input data, e.g. vertices of a regular simplex in RM or.RM ?1 [32]. In summary, the dimensionality of the predictor and codewords are tied to the number.of classes. Next, we propose a method that extends current boosting algorithms 1) to use embeddings.of arbitrary dimensions and 2) to learn the codewords (linear classifiers) based on the input data..In principle, the formulation of section 2 is applicable to any codeword set and the challenge is to find.the optimal codewords for a target dimension d. For this, we propose to leverage the duality between.boosting and SVM. First, use boosting to learn the optimal predictor for a given set of codewords,.and second use SVM to learn the optimal codewords for the given predictor. This procedure, has.two limitations. First, although both are large margin methods, boosting and SVM use different loss.functions (exponential vs hinge). Hence, the procedure is not guaranteed to converge. Second, an.algorithm based on multiple iterations of boosting and SVM learning is computationally intensive..We avoid these problems by formulating the codeword learning problem in the boosting framework.rather than a SVM formulation. For this, we note that, given a predictor f (x), it is possible to learn a.set of codewords that guarantees large margins, under the exponential loss, by solving.\\x1a..maxy1 ...yM.s.t...Pn.1.L[Y, f ] = 2n.i=1 L(Y, zi , f (xi )).k.ky k = 1 ?k.5..(11)...P.zi.j.1.where L(Y, zi , f (xi )) = j6=zi e? 2 hy ?y ,f (xi )i . As is usual in boosting, we propose to solve this.optimization by a gradient descent procedure. Each iteration of the proposed codeword boosting.?L.=.algorithm computes the risk derivatives with respect to all codewords and forms the matrix ?Y.h.i.?L[Y,f ].?L[Y,f ].? ?L.. . . ?yM . The codewords are then updated according to Y = Y ? ? ?Y where.?y 1.\\x14.\\x15.?L.?.? = arg min L Y ? ?.,f ,.(12).?.?Y.is found by a line search. Finally, each codeword y l , is normalized to satisfy the constraint of (11)..This algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 2..Given this algorithm, we are ready to introduce an algorithm that jointly optimizes the codeword.set Y and predictor f . This is implemented using an alternate minimization procedure that iterates.between the following two steps. First, given a codeword set Y, determine the predictor f ? (x) of.minimum risk L[Y, f ]. This is implemented with MCBoost (Algorithm 1). Second, given the optimal.predictor f ? (x), determine the codeword set Y ? of minimum risk L[Y ? , f ? ]. This is implemented.with codeword boosting (Algorithm 2). Note that, unlike the combined SVM-Boosting solution, the.two steps of this algorithm optimize the common risk of (11). Since this risk encourages predictors.of large margin, the algorithm is denoted Large mArgin Discriminant DimEnsionality Reduction.(LADDER). The procedure is summarized in Algorithm 3..Analysis: First, note that the sub-problems solved by each step of LADDER, i.e. the minimization of.L[Y, f ] given Y or f, are convex. However, the overall optimization of (11) is not convex. Hence,.the algorithm will converge to a local optimum, which depends on the initialization conditions. We.propose an initialization procedure motivated by the following intuition. If two of the codewords.are very close, e.g. y j ? y k , then hy j , f (x)i is very similar to hy k , f (x)i and small variations.of x may change the classification results of (3) from k to j and vice-versa. This suggests that.the codewords should be as distant from each other as possible. We thus propose to initialize the.MCBoost codewords with the set of unit vectors of maximum pair-wise distance, e.g..max min ||y j ? y k ||?j 6= k.(13).y 1 ...y M j6=k..For d = M, these codewords can be the canonical basis of RM . We have implemented a barrier.method from [16] to obtain maximum pair-wise distance codeword sets for any d < M ..].Second, Algorithm 2 has interesting intuitions. We start by rewriting the risk derivatives as ?L[Y,f.=.?y j.1 hy j ,f (x )i.P.i.(1?? ).1.?ij.f (xi )Li sij ij where Li = L(Y, zi , f (xi )), sij = P e 2 1 hyk ,f (xi )i , and ?ij = 1.i (?1).2n.k6=zi..e2..if zi = j and ?ij = 0 otherwise. It follows that the update of each codeword along the gradient.].ascent direction, ? ?L[Y,f.?y j , is a weighted average of the predictions f (xi ). Since ?ij is an indicator.of the examples xi in class j, the term (?1)?ij reflects the assignment of examples to the classes..While each xi in class j contributes to the update of y j with a multiple of the prediction f (xi ),.this contribution is ?f (xi ) for examples in classes other than j. Hence, each example xi in class.j pulls y j towards its current prediction f (xi ), while pulling all other codewords in the opposite.direction. This is illustrated in Figure 2. The result is an increase of the dot-product hy j , f (xi )i,.while the dot-products hy k , f (xi )i ?k 6= j decrease. Besides encouraging correct classification, these.dot product adjustments maximize the multiclass margin. This effect is modulated by the weight.(1?? ).of the contribution of each point. This weight is the factor Li sij ij , which has two components..The first, Li , is the loss of the current predictor f (xi ) for example xi . This measures how much.xi contributes to the current risk and is similar to the example weighting mechanism of AdaBoost..Training examples are weighted, so as to emphasize those poorly classified by the current predictor.(1?? ).f (x). The second, sij ij , only affects examples xi that do not belong to class j. For these, the.weight is multiplied by sij . This computes a softmax-like operation among the codeword projections.of f (xi ) and is large when the projection along y j is one of the largest, and small otherwise. Hence,.among examples xi from classes other than j that have equivalent loss Li , the learning algorithm.weights more heavily those most likely to be mistakenly assigned to class j. In result, the emphasis.on incorrectly classified examples is modulated by how much class pairs are confused by the current.predictor. Examples from classes that are more confusable with class j receive larger weight for the.update of the latter..6...60.MCBoost.LADDER.PCA+CLR.ProbPCA+CLR.KernelPCA+CLR.LPP+CLR.NPE+CLR.LDA+CLR..50..error rate..40..30..20..10..0.0..5..10..15.number of dimensions..20..25..30..Figure 3: Left: Initial codewords for the different traffic sign classes. Middle: codewords learned by LADDER..Right: Comparison of error rate using various dimensionality reduction methods...4..Experiments..We start with a traffic sign detection problem that allows some insight on the merits of learning.codewords from data. This experiment was based on ? 2K instances from 17 different types of traffic.signs in the first set of the Summer traffic sign dataset [23], which was split into training and test set..Examples of traffic signs are shown in the left of figure 3. We also collected about 1, 000 background.images, to represent non-traffic sign images, leading to a total of 18 classes. The background class is.shown as a black image in figure 3-left and middle. All images were resized to 40 ? 40 pixels and.the integral channel method of [6] was used to extract 810 features per image..The first experiment compared the performance of traditional multiclass boosting to LADDER. The.former was implemented by running MCBoost (Algorithm 1) for Nb = 200 iterations, using the.optimal solution of (13) as codeword set. LADDER was implemented with Algorithm 3, using.Nb = 2, Nc = 4, and Nr = 100. In both cases, codewords were initialized with the solution.of (13) and the initial assignment of codewords to classes was random. In each experiment, the.learning algorithm was initialized with 5 different random assignments. Figure 3 compares the initial.codewords (Right) to those learned by LADDER (Middle) for a 2-D embedding (d = 2). A video.showing the evolution of the codewords is available in the supplementary materials. The organization.of the learned codewords reflects the semantics of the various classes. Note, for example, how.LADDER clusters the codewords associated with speed limit signs, which were initially scattered.around the unit circle. On the other hand, all traffic sign codewords are pushed away from that of the.background image class. Within the traffic sign class, round signs are positioned in one half-space.and signs of other shapes on the other. Regarding discriminant power, a decision rule learned by.MCBoost achieved 0.44 ? 0.03 error rate, while LADDER achieved 0.21 ? 0.02. In summary,.codeword adaptation produces a significantly more discriminant prediction space..This experiment was repeated for d ? [2, 27], with the results of Figure 3-right. For small d,.LADDER substantially improves on MCBoost (about half error rate for d ? 5). LADDER was.also compared to various classical dimensionality reduction techniques that do not operate on the.prediction space. These included PCA, LDA, Probabilistic PCA [31], Kernel PCA [33], Locally.Preserving Projections (LPP) [14], and Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (NPE) [13]. All.implementations were provided by [1]. For each method, the data was mapped to a lower dimension.d and classified using MCBoost. LADDER outperformed all methods for all dimensions..Hashing and retrieval: Encoding high dimensional image features vectors into short binary codes.for large scale search and retrieval has gained momentum in the last few years [4, 36, 21, 11, 22, 24]..LADDER enables the design of an effective discriminant hash code for retrieval systems. To obtain.a d-bit hash, we learn a predictor f (x) ? Rd . Each predictor coordinate is then thresholded and.mapped to {0, 1}. Retrieval is finally based on the Hamming distance between these hash codes. We.compare this hashing method to a number of popular techniques on CIFAR-10 [19], which contains.60K images of ten classes. Evaluation was based on the test settings of [24], using 1, 000 randomly.selected images. Learning was based on a random set of 2, 000 images, sampled from the remaining.59K. All images are represented as 512-dimensional GIST feature vectors [26]. The 1, 000 test.images were used to query a database containing the remaining 59K images..Table 2-Left shows mean average precision (mAP) scores under different code lengths for LSH [4],.KLSH [22], BRE [21], ITQ [11], MCBoost [32], KSH [24] and LADDER.

First, using a multiclass boosting technique with predefined equally spaced codewords.of (13), MCBoost, we observe a competitive performance; on par with popular approaches such as.ITQ, however slightly worst than KSH. Second, LADDER improves on MCBoost, with mAP gains.that range from 6 to 12%. This is due to its ability of LADDER to adjust/learn codewords according.to the training data. Finally, LADDER outperformed other popular methods for hash code lengths.? 10-bits. These gains are about 5 and 7% as compared to KSH, the second best method..Scene understanding: In this experiment we show that LADDER can provide more efficient dimensionality reduction than regular methods such as PCA. For this we selected the scene understanding.pipeline of [28, 12] that is consists of deep CNNs [20, 17], PCA, Fisher Vectors(FV), SVM. PCA in.this setting is necessary as the Fisher Vectors can become extremely high dimensional. We replaced.the PCA component by embeddings of MCBoost and LADDER and compared their performance.with PCA and other scene classification methods on the MIT Indoor dataset [30]. This is a dataset of.67 indoor scene categories where the standard train/test split contains 80 images for training and 20.images for testing per class. Table 2-Right summarizes performance of different methods. Again.even with plain MCBoost predictor we observe a competitive performance; on par with PCA. The.performance is then improved by LADDER by learning the embedding and codewords jointly...5..Conclusions..In this work we presented a duality between boosting and SVM. This duality is then used to propose.a novel discriminant dimensionality reduction method. We showed that both boosting and K-SVM.maximize the margin, using the combination of a non-linear predictor and linear classification. For.K-SVM, the predictor (induced by kernel) is fixed and the linear classifier learned. For boosting, the.linear classifier is fixed and the predictor is learned. It follows from this duality that 1) the predictor.learned by boosting is a discriminant mapping, and 2) by iterating between boosting and SVM it.should be possible to design better discriminant mappings. We proposed the LADDER algorithm.to efficiently implement the two steps and learn embedding of arbitrary dimension. Experiments.showed that LADDER learns more discriminant low-dimensional spaces...References.[1] Visualizing high-dimensional data using t-sne. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2008..[2] L.

De Bonet & Paul Viola.Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.Learning & Vision Group.545 Technology Square Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Cambridge, MA 02139.EMAIL: jsd@ai.mit.edu & viola@ai.mit.edu.HOMEPAGE: http://www.ai .mit. edu/projects/lv..Abstract.The observed distribution of natural images is far from uniform..On the contrary, real images have complex and important structure that can be exploited for image processing, recognition and.analysis. There have been many proposed approaches to the principled statistical modeling of images, but each has been limited in.either the complexity of the models or the complexity of the images. We present a non-parametric multi-scale statistical model for.images that can be used for recognition, image de-noising, and in.a \"generative mode\" to synthesize high quality textures...1..Introduction..In this paper we describe a multi-scale.structure of natural images across many.it can be used to recognize novel images,.tasks is reasonably efficient, requiring no.workstation...statistical model which can capture the.scales. Once trained on example images,.or to generate new images. Each of these.more than a few seconds or minutes on a..The statistical modeling of images is an endeavor which reaches back to the 60\\'s.and 70\\'s (Duda and Hart, 1973). Statistical approaches are alluring because they.provide a unified view of learning, classification and generation. To date however, a.generic, efficient and unified statistical model for natural images has yet to appear..Nevertheless, many approaches have shown significant competence in specific areas..Perhaps the most influential statistical model for generic images is the Markov.random field (MRF) (Geman and Geman, 1984). MRF\\'s define a distribution over...774..J. S. D. Bonet and P. A. Viola..images that is based on simple and local interactions between pixels. Though MRF\\'s.have been very successfully used for restoration of images, their generative properties are weak. This is due to the inability of the MRF \\'s to capture long range.(low frequency) interactions between pixels. Recently there has been a great deal of.interest in hierarchical models such as the Helmholtz machine (Hinton et al., 1995;.Dayan et al. , 1995). Though the Helmholtz machine can be trained to discover long.range structure, it is not easily applied to natural images..Multi-scale wavelet models have emerged as an effective technique for modeling.realistic natural images. These techniques hypothesize that the wavelet transform.measures the underlying causes of natural images which are assumed to be statistically independent. The primary evidence for this conjecture is that the coefficients of.wavelet transformed images are uncorrelated and low in entropy (hence the success.of wavelet compression) . These insights have been used for noise reduction (Donoho.and Johnstone, 1993; Simoncelli and Adelson, 1996), and example driven texture.synthesis (Heeger and Bergen, 1995). The main drawback of wavelet algorithms is.the assumption of complete independence between coefficients. We conjecture that.in fact there is strong cross-scale dependence between the wavelet coefficients of an.image, which is consistent with observations in (De Bonet, 1997) and (Buccigrossi.and Simoncelli, 1997)...2..Multi-scale Statistical Models..Multi-scale wavelet techniques assume that images are a linear transform of a collection of statistically independent random variables: 1= W-1C, where I is an image,.W- 1 is the inverse wavelet transform, and C = {Ck} is a vector of random variable.\"causes\" which are assumed to be independent. The distribution of each cause Ck is.Pk ( . ), and since the Ck\\'S are independent it follows that: p( C) =.k Pk (Ck). Various.wavelet transforms have been developed, but all share the same type of multi-scale.structure - each row of the wavelet matrix W is a spatially localized filter that is.a shifted and scaled version of a single basis function...n..The wavelet transform is most efficiently computed as an iterative convolution using.a bank of filters . First a \"pyramid\" of low frequency downsampled images is created:.Go = I , G 1 = 2 ..!-(9 ? Go), and Gi+l = 2 ..!-(9 ? Gi ), where 2..!- downsamples an.image by a factor of 2 in each dimension, ? is the convolution operation, and 9 is.a low pass filter. At each level a series offilter functions are applied: Fj = h (j!) Gj,.where the Ii \\'s are various types of filters. Computation of the Fj\\'s is a linear.transformation that can thought of as a single matrix W. With careful selection.of 9 and h this matrix can be constructed so that W- 1 = W T (Simoncelli et al.,.1992)1. Where convenient we will combine the pixels of the feature images Fj(x, y).into a single cause vector C..The expected distribution of causes, Ck, is a function of the image classes that are.being modeled. For example it is possible to attempt to model the space of all.natural images. In that case it appears as though the most accurate Pk (.) \\'s are.highly kurtotic which indicates that the Ck \\' S are most often zero but in rare cases.take on very large values (Donoho and Johnstone, 1993; Simoncelli and Adelson,.1996) . This is in direct contrast to the distribution of Ck\\'S for white-noise images which is gaussian. The difference in these distributions can be used as the basis.of noise reduction algorithms, by reducing the wavelet coefficients which are more.lComputation of the inverse wavelet transform is algorithmically similar to the computation of the forward wavelet transform....Non-Parametric Multi-Scale Statistical Image Model..775..likely to be noise than signal..Specific image classes can be modeled using similar methods (Heeger and Bergen,.1995)2. For a given set of input images the empirical distribution of the Ck\\'S is.observed. To generate a novel example of a texture a new set of causes, (}, is sampled.from the assumed independent empirical distributions Pk (.). The generated images.are computed using the inverse wavelet transform: l\\' = W- 1 (},. Bergen and Heeger.have used this approach to build a probabilistic model of a texture from a ::;ingle.example image. To do this they assume that textures are spatially ergodic - that.the expected distribution is not a function of position in the image. As a result the.pixels in anyone feature image, Fj(x, y), are samples from the same distribution.and can be combined 3 ..Heeger and Bergen\\'s work is at or near the current state of the art in texture.generation. Figure 1 contains some example textures. Notice however, that this.technique is much better at generating smooth or noise-like textures than those.with well defined structure. Image structures, such as the sharp edges at the border.of the tiles in the rightmost texture can not be modeled with their approach. These.image features directly contradict the assumption that the wavelet coefficients, or.causes, of the image are independent..For many types of natural images the coefficients of the wavelet transform are not.independent, for example images which contain long edges. While wavelets are local.both in frequency and space, a long edge is not local in frequency nor in space. As.a result the wavelet representation of such a feature requires many coefficients. The.high frequencies of the edge are captured by many small high frequency wavelets..The long scale is captured by a number of larger low frequency wavelets. A model.which assumes these coefficients are independent can never accurately model images.which contain these non-local features. Conversely a model which captures the.conditional dependencies between coefficients will be much more effective. We chose.to approximate the joint distribution of coefficients as a chain, in which coefficients.that occur higher in the wavelet pyramid condition the distribution of coefficients.at lower levels (Le. low frequencies condition the generation of higher frequencies)..For every pixel in an image define the parent vector of that pixel:..V....

Rather.than generating each of these coefficients independently, we define a chain across.scale. In this chain the generation of the lower levels depend on the higher levels:..p(V(x, y))..= p(VM(x, y))..x p(VM- 1 (x, y)IVM(x, y))..x p(VM-2(X, y)!VM-l (x, y), VM(x, y)) x ....x p(Vo(x, y)IVl (x, y), ... , VM-l (x, y), VM(x, y))..(2)..2See (Zhu, Wu and Mumford, 1996) for a related but more formal model..3Their generation process is slightly more complex than this, involving a iteration.designed to match the pixel histogram. The implementation used for generating the images.in Figure 1 incorporates this, but we do not discuss it here....776..1. S. D. Bonet and P. A. Viola..Figure 1: Synthesis results for the Heeger and Bergen (1995) model. Top: Input.textures. BOTTOM: Synthesis results. This technique is much better at generating.fine or noisy textures then it is at generating textures which require co-occurrence.of wavelets at multiple scales...Figure 2: Synthesis results using our technique for the input textures shown in.Figure 1 (Top)...where Yt(x , y) is the a subset of the elements of Vex , y) computed from C/. Usually.we will assume ergodicity, i.e. that p(V(x, y)) is independent of x and y. The generative process starts from the top of the pyramid, choosing values for the VM (x, y).at all points. Once these are generated the values at the next level, VM -1 (x , y) , are.generated. The process continues until all of the wavelet coefficients are generated..Finally the image is computed using the inverse wavelet transform..It is important to note that this probabilistic model is not made up of a collection.of independent chains, one for each Vex , y). Parent vectors for neighboring pixels.have substantial overlap as coefficients in the higher pyramid levels (which are...Non-Parametric Multi-Scale Statistical Image Model..777..lower resolution) are shared by neighboring pixels at lower pyramid levels. Thus,.the generation of nearby pixels will be strongly dependent. In a related approach a.similar arrangement of generative chains has been termed a Markov tree (Basseville.et al., 1992)...2.1..Estimating the Conditional Distributions..The additional descriptive power of our generative model does not come without.cost. The conditional distributions that appear in (2) must be estimated from.observations. We choose to do this directly from the data in a non-parametric.fashion. Given a sample of parent vectors {8(x, y)} from an example image we.estimate the conditional distribution as a ratio of Parzen window density estimators:.p(..~(.I..x,y..)1v,M (./+1..x,y..)) _ p(ViM(x,y)).-..\\'\" Lx\\',y\\' R(V;M(X,y), 8r(x\\', y\\')).....

We have explored various R(?) functions. In the results presented the.R( .) function returns a fixed constant 1/ z if all of the coefficients of the vectors are within some threshold () and zero otherwise. Given this simple definition for R(?) sampling from p(Vz(x,Y)IV;~1(X,y)) is very straightforward: find all.x\\', y\\' such that R(8#1 (x\\', y\\'), 8#1 (x, y)) = 1/ z and pick from among them to set.Vz(x,y) = SI(X\\',y\\')...3..Experiments..We have applied this approach to the problems of texture generation, texture recognition, target recognition, and signal de-noising. In each case our results are competitive with the best published approaches..In Figure 2 we show the results of our technique on the textures from Figure 1..For these textures we are better able to model features which are caused by a.conjunction of wavelets. This is especially striking in the rightmost texture where.the geometrical tiling is almost, but not quite, preserved. In our model, knowledge of.the joint distribution provides constraints which are critical in the overall perceived.appearance of the synthesized texture..Using this same model, we can measure the textural similarity between a known and.novel image. We do this by measuring the likelihood of generating the parent vectors.in the novel image under the chain model of the known image. On \"easy\" data.sets, such as the the MeasTex Brodatz texture test suite, performance is slightly.higher than other techniques, our approach achieved 100% correct classification.compared to 97% achieved by a gaussian MRF approach (Chellappa and Chatterjee,.1985). The MeasTex lattice test suite is slightly more difficult because each.texture is actually a composition of textures containing different spatial frequencies..Our approach achieved 97% while the best alternate method, in this case Gabor.Convolution Energy method (Fogel and Sagi, 1989) achieved 89%. Gaussian MRF\\'s.explicitly assume that the texture is a unimodal distribution and as a result achieve.only 79% correct recognition. We also measured performance on a set of 20 types.of natural texture and compared the classification power of this model to that of.human observers (humans discriminate textures extremely accurately.)

De-noising of an observed.image i can be performed by Monte Carlo averaging: draw a number of sample.images according to the prior density P(I), compute the likelihood of the noise for.each image P(v = (1) - 1), and then find the weighted average over these images..The weighted average is the estimated mean over all possible ways that the image.might have been generated given the observation..Image de-noising frequently relies on generic image models which simply enforce.image smoothness. These priors either leave a lot of residual noise or remove much.of the original image. In contrast, we construct a probability density model from.the noisy image itself. In effect we assume that the image is redundant, containing.many examples of the same visual structures, as if it were a texture. The value of.this approach is directly related to the redundancy in the image. If the redundancy.in the image is very low, then the parent structures will be everywhere different, and.the only resampled images with significant likelihood will be the original image. But.if there is some redundancy in the image - that might arise from a regular texture.or smoothly varying patch - the resampling will freely average across these similar.regions. This will have the effect of reducing noise in these images. In Figure 3 we.show results of this de-noising approach....Non-Parametric Multi-Scale Statistical Image Model..4..779..Conclusions..We have presented a statistical model of texture which can be trained using example images. The form of the model is a conditional chain across scale on a pyramid of wavelet coefficients. The cross scale condtional distributions are estimated.non-parametrically. This is important because many of the observed conditional.distributions are complex and contain multiple modes. We believe that there are.two main weaknesses of the current approach: i) the tree on which the distributions.are defined are fixed and non-overlapping; and ii) the conditional distributions are.estimated from a small number of samples. We hope to address these limitations.in future work...Acknowledgments.In this research, Jeremy De Bonet is supported by the DOD Multidisciplinary Research Program of the University Research Initiative, and Paul Viola by Office of.Naval Research Grant No. N00014-96-1-0311...References.Basseville, M., Benveniste, A., Chou, K.

In contrast, the nervous systems of natural.animals exhibit great heterogeneity in both their elements and patterns.of interconnection. This heterogeneity is crucial to the flexible.generation of behavior which is essential for survival in a complex,.dynamic environment. It may also provide powerful insights into the.design of artificial neural networks. In this paper, we describe a.heterogeneous neural network for controlling the wa1king of a.simulated insect. This controller is inspired by the neuroethological.and neurobiological literature on insect locomotion. It exhibits a.variety of statically stable gaits at different speeds simply by varying.the tonic activity of a single cell. It can also adapt to perturbations as a.natural consequence of its design...INTRODUCTION.Even very simple animals exhibit a dazzling variety of complex behaviors which they.continuously adapt to the changing circumstances of their environment. Nervous systems.evolved in order to generate appropriate behavior in dynamic, uncertain situations and.thus insure the survival of the organisms containing them. The function of a nervous.system is closely tied to its structure. Indeed, the heterogeneity of nervous systems has.been found to be crucial to those few behaviors for which the underlying neura1 mechanisms have been worked out in any detail [Selverston, 1988]. There is every reason to.believe that this conclusion will remain valid as more complex nervous systems are studied:.The brain as an \"organ\" is much more diversified than, for example, the.kidney or the liver. If the performance of relatively few liver cells is.known in detail, there is a good chance of defining the role of the whole.organ. In the brain, different ce))s perform different, specific tasks....Only rarely can aggregates of neurons be treated as though they were.homogeneous. Above all, the cells in the brain are connected with one.another according to a complicated but specific design that is of far.greater complexity than the connections between cells in other organs..([Kuffler, Nicholls, & Martin, 1984], p. 4)...578..Beer, Chiel and Sterling..In contrast to research on biological nervous systems, work in artificial neural networks.has primarily emphasized uniform networks of simple processing units with a regular interconnection scheme. These homogeneous networks typically depend upon some general learning procedure to train them to perform specific tasks. This approach has certain.advantages. Such networks are analytically tractable and one can often prove theorems.about their behavior. Furthermore, such networks have interesting computational properties with immediate practical applications. In addition, the necessity of training these networks has resulted in a resurgence of interest in learning, and new training procedures are.being developed. When these procedures succeed, they allow the rapid construction of.networks which perform difficult tasks..However, we believe that the role of learning may have been overemphasized in artificial.neural networks, and that the architectures and heterogeneity of biological nervous systems have been unduly neglected. We may learn a great deal from more careful study of.the design of biological nervous systems and the relationship of this design to behavior..Toward this end, we are exploring the ways in which the architecture of the nervous.systems of simpler organisms can be utilized in the design of artificial neural networks..We are particularly interested in developing neural networks capable of continuously.synthesizing appropriate behavior in dynamic, underspecified, and uncertain.environments of the sort encountered by natural animals...THE ARTIFICIAL INSECT PROJECT.In order to address these issues, we have begun to construct a simulated insect which we.call Periplaneta compUlatrix. Our ultimate goal is to design a nervous system capable of.endowing this insect with a1l of the behaviors required for long-term survival in a complex and dynamic simulated environment similar to that of natural insects. The skills required to survive in this environment include the basic abilities to move around, to find.and consume food when necessary, and to escape from predators. In this paper, we focus.on the design of that portion of the insect\\'s nervous system which controls its locomotion..In designing this insect and the nervous system which controls it, we are inspired by the.biological literature. It is important to emphasize, however, that this is not a modeling.project. We are not altempting to reproduce the experimental data on a particular animal;.rather, we are using insights gleaned from Biology to design neural networks capable of.generating similar behaviors. In this manner, we hope to gain a better understanding of.the role heterogeneity plays in the generation of behavior by nervous systems, and to abstract design principles for use in artificial neural networks...Figure 1. Periplaneta computatrix...Heterogeneous Neural Networks for Adaptive Behavior..BODY.The body of our artificial insect is shown in Figure 1. It is loosely based on the American.Cockroach. Periplaneta americana [Bell & Adiyodi. 1981]. However. it is a reasonable.abstraction of the bodies of most insects. It consists of an abdomen. head. six legs with.feet. two antennae. and two cerci in the rear. The mouth can open and close and contains.tactile and chemical sensors. The antennae also contain tactile and chemical sensors..The cerci contain tactile and wind sensors. The feet may be \\'either up or down. When a.foot is down. it appears as a black square. Finally. a leg can apply forces which translate.and rotate the body whenever its foot is down..In addition. though the insect is only two-dimensional, it is capable of \"falling down.\".Whenever its center of mass falls outside of the polygon formed by its supporting feet,.the insect becomes statically unstable. If this condition persists for any length of time..then we say that the insect has \"fallen down\" and the legs are no longer able to move the.body...NEURAL MODEL.The essential challenge of the Artificial Insect Project is to design neural controllers capable of generating the behaviors necessary to the insect\\'s survival. The neural model.that we are currently using to construct our controllers is shown in Figure 2. It represents.the firing frequency of a cell as a function of its input potential. We have used saturating.linear threshold functions for this relationship (see inset). The RC characteristics of the.cell membrane are also represented. These cells are interconnected by weighted synapses.which can cause currents to flow through this membrane. Finally, our model includes the.possibility of additional intrinsic currents which may be time and voltage dependent..These currents aJlow us to capture some of the intrinsic propenies which make real neurons unique and have proven to be important components of the neural mechanisms underlying many behaviors...I(V)le..Intrinsic.Currents..v..v..Synaptic.Currents..Firing.Frequency..C..Cell.Membrane..Firing.Properties..Figure 2. Neural Model..579...580..Beer, Chiel and Sterling..For example, a pacemaker cell is a neuron which is capable of endogenously producing.rhythmic bursting. Pacemakers have been implicated in a number of temporally patterned behaviors and playa crucial role in our locomotion controller. As described by.Kandel (1976, pp. 260-268), a pacemaker cell exhibits the following characteristics: (1).when it is sufficiently inhibited, it is silent, (2) when it is sufficiently excited, it bursts.continuously, (3) between these extremes, the interburst interval is a continuous function.of the membrane potential, (4) a transient excitation which causes the cell to fire between.bursts can reset the bursting rhythm, and (5) a transient inhibition which prematurely terminates a burst can also reset the bursting rhythm..These characteristics can be reproduced with our neural model through the addition of.two intrinsic currents. IH is a depolarizing current which tends to pull the membrane potential above threshold. IL is a hyperpolarizing current which tends to pull the membrane.potential below threshold. These currents change according to the following rules: (1).IH is triggered whenever the cell goes above threshold or IL terminates, and it then remains active for a fixed period of time, and (2) IL is triggered whenever IH terminates,.and it then remains acti ve for a variable period of time whose duration is a function of the.membrane potential. In our work to date, the voltage dependence of IL has been linear...LOCOMOTION.An animal\\'s ability to move around its environment is fundamental to many of its other.behaviors. In most insects, this requirement is fulfilled by six-legged walking. Thus, this.was the first capability we sought to provide to P. computatrix. Walking involves the.generation of temporally patterned forces and stepping movements such that the insect.maintains a steady forward motion at a variety of speeds without falling down. Though.we do not address all of these issues here, it is worth pointing out that locomotion is an.interesting adaptive behavior in its own right. An insect robustly solves this complex coordination problem in real Lime in the presence of variations in load and terrain, developmental changes, and damage to the walking apparatus itself [Graham, 1985]...LEG CONTROLLER.The most basic components of walking are the rhythmic movements of each individual.leg. These consist of a swing phase, in which the foot is up and the leg is swinging forward, and a stance phase, in which the foot is down and the leg is swinging back, propelling the body forward. In our controller, these rhythmic movements are produced by the.leg controller circuit shown in Figure 3. There is one command neuron, C, for the entire.controller and six copies of the remainder of this circuit, one for each leg..The rhythmic leg movements are primarily generated centrally by the portion of the leg.controller shown in solid lines in Figure 3. Each leg is controlled by three motor neurons..The stance and swing motor neurons determine the force with which the leg is swung.backward or forward, respectively, and the foot motor neuron controls whether the foot is.up or down. Normally, the foot is down and the stance motor neuron is active, pushing...Heterogeneous Neural Networks for Adaptive Behavior..the leg back and producing a stance phase. Periodically, however, this state is interrupted.by a burst from the pacemaker neuron P. This burst inhibits the foot and stance motor.neurons and excites the swing motor neuron, lifting the foot and swinging the leg forward. When this burst terminates, another stance phase begins. Rhythmic bursting in P.thus produces the basic swing/stance cycle required for walking. The force applied during each stance phase as well as the time between bursts in P depend upOn the level of excitation supplied by the command neuron C. This basic design is based on the flexor.burst-generator model of cockroach walking [pearson, 1976]..In order to properly time the transitions between the swing and stance phases, the controller must have some information about where the legs actually are. The simplest way to.provide this information is to add sensors which signal when a leg has reached an extreme forward or backward angle, as shown with dashed lines in Figure 3. When the leg.is all the way back, the backward angle sensor encourages P to initiate a swing by exciting it. When the leg is all the way forward, the forward angle sensor encourages P to terminate the swing by inhibiting it. These sensors serve to reinforce and fine-tune the cen?.trally generated stepping rhythm. They were inspired by the hair plate receptors in P..americana, which seem LO playa similar role in its locomotion [Pearson, 1976]..The RC characteristics of our neural model cause delays at the end of each swing before.the next stance phase begins. This pause produces a \"jerky\" walk which we sought to.avoid. In order to smooth out this effect, we added a stance reflex comprised of the dotted connections shown in Figure 3. This reflex gives the motor neurons a slight \"kick\" in.the right direction to begin a stance whenever the leg is swung all the way forward and is.also inspired by the cockroach [Pearson, 1976]...Backward Angle.Sensor..Stance..Foot..Swing..O~ ? ?..\"-..... :. . . . \\'. \\'. \\'... \\'. ~:~:D..?.......................Forward Angle.Sensor..E>-..Excitatory Connection.._..Inhibitory Connection..Figure 3. Leg Controller Circuit..581...582..Beer, Chiel and Sterling..Figure 4. Central Coupling between Pacemakers..LOCOMOTION CONTROLLER.In order for these six individual leg controllers to serve as the basis for a locomotion controller, we must address the issue of stability. Arbitrary patterns of leg movements will.not, in general, lead to successful locomotion. Rather, the movements of each leg must.be synchronized in such a way as to continuously maintain stability..A good rule of thumb is that adjacent legs should be discouraged from swinging at the.same time. As shown in Figure 4, this constraint was implemented by mutual inhibition.between the pacemakers of adjacent legs. So, for example, when leg L2 is swinging, legs.L I, L3 and R2 are discouraged from also swinging, but legs RI and R3 are unaffected (see.Figure Sa for leg labelings). This coupling scheme is also derived from Pearson\\'s (1976).work..The gaits adopted by the controller described above depend in general upon the initial angles of the legs. To further enhance stability, it is desirable to impose some reliable order.to the stepping sequence. Many animals exhibit a stepping sequence known as a metachronal wave, in which a wave of stepping progresses from back to front. In insects, for example, the back leg swings, then the middle one, then the front one on each side of the.body. This sequence is achieved in our controller by slightly increasing the leg angle.ranges of the rear legs, lowering their stepping frequency. Under these conditions, the.rear leg oscillators entrain the middle and front ones, and produce metachronal waves.[Graham, 1977]...RESULTS.When this controller is embedded in the body of our simulated insect, it reliably produces.successful walking. We have found that the insect can be made to walk at different.speeds with a variety of gaits simply by varying the flring frequency of the command.neuron C. Observed gaits range from the wave gait, in which the metachronal waves on.each side of the body are very nearly separated, to the tripod gait, in which the front and.back legs on each side of the body step with the middle leg on the opposite side. These.gaits fall out of the interaction between the dynamics of the neural controller and the.body in which it is embedded....Heterogeneous Neural Networks for Adaptive Behavior..L~R.I..I..t..Z..S..3..It3...$1q\\'plq._ ,dIrII -.._..a,..JI2.._.._..L3.._..,nT, iii..L2_.Ll ii i..It3.._..-..i.,..-..ii i..-..-..-..-..?..1m. iii\\' iii i 1m: i Ii iii, ,..25~dlv..stq\\'pfq.\\'dIrII._._.._..-..112..al __.__.__ _..U.L3. _.Ll.._...\"iI ....-.._..-.._..-..?..-.._._.hi \\'liihi \" \" \" \" Ii i hi iii Ii liiii i i..25 --=vdlv..----------??._IIIJ11l\\'aMm...1 _..R2 _.It3..----- - - L3.L2.Ll... -..........~.tI,: I...1t,1_11, _ _.AS..\"...,., ,,--\\'.. \\\\ . :~I.p..I..LS!..;:..\\'\\'\\'\\'_..-...,..L, \\'...-,\\', . ? ll ? ?.. ~ - . . \\' ~..? . ? ? ?_..\"..?.?? _..-..A...25 -\\'Ct,v..-..-..-..al._._.1.2 _._._._-..u ___..-..-..,.\"\\'ii.i \\'irm ?? ;?? .wriii\\'iilWt..1t3 _ _.._..:..,1.._ :..~\\'iii Ii..&ea\\'p.ptq I\\'dIrII..-... -..__.__..L 1 \"Ii.._..-..mTII Ii 1i\\'l\\'lT! \" Ii i \" \" I i \".25~d,v..-..-..i..~\\'mT i Ii ill..B...Figure S. (A) Description of Some Gaits Observed in Natural Insects (from [Wilson,.1966]). (B) Selected Gaits Observed in P. computatrix..If the legs .are labeled as shown at the top of Figure Sa, then gaits may be conveniently.described by their stepping patterns. In this representation, a black bar is displayed during the swing phase of each leg. The space between bars represents the stance phase..Selected gaits observed in P. computatrix at different speeds are shown in Figure 5b as.the command neuron firing frequency is varied from lowest (top) to highest (bottom). At.the lower speeds, the metachronal waves on each ~ide of the body are very apparent. The.metachronal waves can still be discerned in fas~r walks. However, they increasingly.overlap as the stance phases shorten, until the tripod gait appears at the highest speeds..This sequence of gaits bears a strong resemblance to some of those that have beep described for natural insects, as shown in Figure Sa [Wilson, 1966]..In order to study the robustness of this controller and to gain insight into the detailed.mechanisms of its operation, we have begun a series of lesion studies. Such studies ex-..583...584..Beer, Chiel and Sterling..amine the behavioral effects of selective damage to a neural controller. This study is still.in progress and we only report a few preliminary results here. In general, we have been.repeatedly surprised by the intricacy of the dynamics of this controller. For example, removal of all of the forward angle sensors resulted in a complete breakdown of the.metachronal wave at low speeds. However, at higher speeds, the gait was virtually unaffected. Only brief periods of instability caused by the occasional overlap of the slightly.longer than normal swing phases were observed in the tripod gait, but the insect did not.fall down. Lesioning single forward angle sensors often dynamically produced compensatory phase shifts in the other legs. Lesions of selected central connections produced.similarly interesting effects. In general, our studies seem to suggest subtle interactions.between the central and peripheral components of the controller which deserve much.more exploration..Finally, we have observed the phenomena of reflex stepping in P. computalrix. When the.central locomotion system is completely shut down by strongly inhibiting the command.neuron and the insect is continuously pushed from behind, it is still capable of producing.an uncoordinated kind of walking. As the insect is pushed forward, a leg whose foot is.down bends back until the backward angle sensor initiates a swing by exciting the pacemaker neuron P. When the leg has swung all the way forward, the stance reflex triggered.by the forward angle sensor puts the foot down and the cycle repeats..Brooks (1989) has described a semi-distributed locomotion controller for an insect-like.autonomous robot. We are very much in agreement with his general approach..However, his controller is not as fully distributed as the one described above. It relies on.a central leg lift sequencer which must be modified to produce different gaits. Donner.(1985) has also implemented a distributed hexapod locomotion controller inspired by an.early model of Wilson\\'s (1966). His design used individual leg controllers driven by leg.load and position information. These leg controllers were coupled by forward excitation.from posterior legs. Thus, his stepping movements were produced by reflex-driven peripheral oscillators rather than the central oscillators used in our model. He did not report.the generation of the series of gaits shown in Figure Sa. Donner also demonstrated the.ability of his controller to adapt to a missing leg. We have experimented with leg amputations as well, but with mixed success. We feel that more accurate three-dimensional.load information than we currently model is necessary for the proper handling of amputations. Neither of these other locomotion controllers utilize neural networks...CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK.We have described a heterogeneous neural network for controlling the walking of a simulated insect. This controller is completely distributed yet capable of reliably producing a.range of statically stable gaits at different walking speeds simply by varying the tonic activity of a single command neuron. Lesion studies have demonstrated that the controller.is robust, and suggested that subtle interactions and dynamic compensatory mechanisms.are responsible for this robustness..This controller is serving as the basis for a number of other behaviors.

In the near future, we plan to implement feeding behavior.and an escape response, resulting in what we feel is the minimum complement of behaviors necessary for survival in an insect-like environment Finally, we wish to introduce.plasticity into these controllers so that they may better adapt to the exigencies of particular environments. We believe that learning is best viewed as a means by which additional.flexibility can be added to an existing controller..The locomotion controller described in this paper was inspired by the literature on insect.locomotion. The further development of P. compUlalrix will continue to draw inspiration.from the neuroethology and neurobiology of simpler natural organisms. In trying to design autonomous organisms using principles gleaned from Biology, we may both improve our understanding of natural nervous systems and discover design principles of use.to the construction of artificial ones. A robot with \"only\" the behavioral repertoire and.adaptability of an insect would be an impressive achievement indeed. In particular, we.have argued in this paper for a more careful consideration of the intrinsic architecture and.heterogeneity of biological nervous systems in the design of artificial neural networks..The locomotion controller we have described above only hints at how productive such an.approach can be..References.Bell, W.J. and K.G.

Our method, NGCA.(non-Gaussian component analysis), uses a very general semi-parametric.framework. In contrast to existing projection methods we define what is.uninteresting (Gaussian): by projecting out uninterestingness, we can estimate the relevant non-Gaussian subspace. We show that the estimation.error of finding the non-Gaussian components tends to zero at a parametric rate. Once NGCA components are identified and extracted, various.tasks can be applied in the data analysis process, like data visualization,.clustering, denoising or classification. A numerical study demonstrates.the usefulness of our method...1..Introduction..Suppose {Xi }ni=1 are i.i.d. samples in a high dimensional space Rd drawn from an unknown distribution with density p(x) . A general multivariate distribution is typically too.complex to analyze from the data, thus dimensionality reduction is necessary to decrease.the complexity of the model (see, e.g., [4, 11, 10, 12, 1]). We will follow the rationale.that in most real-world applications the ?signal? or ?information? contained in the highdimensional data is essentially non-Gaussian while the ?rest? can be interpreted as high.dimensional Gaussian noise. Thus we implicitly fix what is not interesting (Gaussian part).and learn its orthogonal complement, i.e. what is interesting. We call this approach nonGaussian components analysis (NGCA)..We want to emphasize that we do not assume the Gaussian components to be of smaller.order of magnitude than the signal components. This setting therefore excludes the use.of common (nonlinear) dimensionality reduction methods such as Isomap [12], LLE [10],.that are based on the assumption that the data lies, say, on a lower dimensional manifold,.up to some small noise distortion. In the restricted setting where the number of Gaussian.components is at most one and all the non-Gaussian components are mutually independent,.Independent Component Analysis (ICA) techniques (e.g., [9]) are applicable to identify the.non-Gaussian subspace....A framework closer in spirit to NGCA is that of projection pursuit (PP) algorithms [5, 7, 9],.where the goal is to extract non-Gaussian components in a general setting, i.e., the number.of Gaussian components can be more than one and the non-Gaussian components can be.dependent. Projection pursuit methods typically proceed by fixing a single index which.measures the non-Gaussianity (or ?interestingness?) of a projection direction. This index is.then optimized to find a good direction of projection, and the procedure is iterated to find.further directions. Note that some projection indices are suitable for finding super-Gaussian.components (heavy-tailed distribution) while others are suited for identifying sub-Gaussian.components (light-tailed distribution) [9]. Therefore, traditional PP algorithms may not.work effectively if the data contains, say, both super- and sub-Gaussian components..Technically, the NGCA approach to identify the non-Gaussian subspace uses a very general semi-parametric framework based on a central property: there exists a linear mapping.h 7? ?(h) ? Rd which, to any arbitrary (smooth) nonlinear function h : Rd ? R, associates a vector ? lying in the non-Gaussian subspace. Using a whole family of different.b which all approximately.nonlinear functions h then yields a family of different vectors ?(h).lie in, and span, the non-Gaussian subspace. We finally perform PCA on this family of vectors to extract the principal directions and estimate the target space. Our main theoretical.contribution in this paper is to prove consistency.of the NGCA procedure, i.e. that the.p.above estimation error vanishes at a rate log(n)/n with the sample size n. In practice,.we consider functions of the particular form h?,a (x) = fa (h?, xi) where f is a function.class parameterized, say, by a parameter a, and k?k = 1..Apart from the conceptual point, defining uninterestingness as the point of departure instead of interestingness, another way to look at our method is to say that it allows the.combination of information coming from different indices h: here the above function f a.(for fixed a) plays a role similar to that of a non-Gaussianity index in PP, but we do combine a rich family of such functions (by varying a and even by considering several function.classes at the same time). The important point here is while traditional projection pursuit.does not provide a well-founded justification for combining directions obtained from different indices, our framework allows to do precisely this ? thus implicitly selecting, in a.given family of indices, the ones which are the most informative for the data at hand (while.always maintaining consistency)..In the following section we will outline our main theoretical contribution, a novel semiparametric theory for linear dimension reduction. Section 3 discusses the algorithmic procedures and simulation results underline the usefulness of NGCA; finally a brief conclusion.is given...2..Theoretical framework..The model. We assume the unknown probability density function p(x) of the observations in Rd is of the form.p(x) = g(T x)?? (x),.(1).where T is an unknown linear mapping from Rd to another space Rm with m ? d ,.g is an unknown function on Rm , and ?? is a centered Gaussian density with unknown.covariance matrix ? . The above decomposition may be possible for any density p since g.can be any function. Therefore, this decomposition is not restrictive in general..Note that the model (1) includes as particular cases both the pure parametric ( m = 0 ) and.pure non-parametric ( m = d ) models. We effectively consider an intermediate case where.d is large and m is rather small. In what follows we denote by I the m -dimensional linear.subspace in Rd generated by the dual operator T > :.I = Ker(T )? = Range(T > ) ....We call I the non-Gaussian subspace. Note how this definition implements the general.point of view outlined in the introduction: by this model we define rather what is considered.uninteresting, i.e. the null space of T ; the target space is defined indirectly as the orthogonal.of the uninteresting component. More precisely, using the orthogonal decomposition X =.X0 +XI , where X0 ? Ker(T ) and XI ? I, equation (1) implies that conditionally to XI ,.X0 has a Gaussian distribution. X0 is therefore ?not interesting? and we wish to project it.out..Our goal is therefore to estimate I by some subspace Ib computed from i.i.d. samples.{Xi }ni=1 which follows the distribution with density p(x). In this paper we assume the.effective dimension m to be known or fixed a priori by the user. Note that we do not.estimate ? , g , and T when estimating I..Population analysis. The main idea underlying our approach is summed up in the following Proposition (proof in Appendix). Whenever variable X has covariance matrix identity, this result allows, from an arbitrary smooth real function h on Rd , to find a vector.?(h) ? I..Proposition 1 Let X be a random variable whose density function p(x) satisfies (1).d.and suppose.that.?.? h(x) is a smooth real function on R . Assume furthermore that.>.? = E XX.= Id . Then under mild regularity conditions the following vector belongs to the target space I:.?(h) = E [?h ? Xh(X)] ...(2)..Estimation using empirical data. Since the unknown density p(x) is used to define ?.by Eq.(2), one can not directly use this formula in practice, and it must be approximated.using the empirical data. We therefore have to estimate the population expectations using.empirical ones. A bound on the corresponding approximation error is then given by the.following theorem:.Theorem 1 Let h be a smooth function. Assume that supy max (k?h(y)k , kh(y)k) < B.?.?.and that X has covariance matrix E XX > = Id and is such that for some ?0 > 0:.E [exp (?0 kXk)] ? a0 < ?...Denote e.h(x) = ?h(x) ? xh(x).

The proof of the theorem relies on standard tools using Chernoff?s bounding method and is omitted for space. In this theorem, the covariance matrix of X is assumed.to be known and equal to identity which is not a realistic assumption; in practice, we use.a standard ?whitening? procedure (see next section) using the empirical covariance matrix..Of course there is an additional error coming from this step, since the covariance matrix.is also estimated empirically. In the extended version of the paper [3], we prove (under.somewhat stronger assumptions) a bound for the entirely empirical procedure including.whitening, resulting in an approximation error of the same order in n (up to a logarithmic.factor). This result was omitted here due to space constraints....b.2. Fixing ?, Theorem 1 implies that the vector ?(h).obtained from any h(x)?converges to.the unknown non-Gaussian subspace I at a ?parametric? rate of order 1/ n . Furthermore, the theorem gives us an estimation of the relative size of the p.estimation error for.different functions h through the (computable from the data) factor ?.b(h) in the main.term of the bound. This suggests using this quantity as a renormalizing factor so that the.typical approximation error is (roughly) independent of the function h used. This normalization principle will be used in the main procedure..3. Note the theorem results in an exponential deviation inequality (the dependence in the.confidence level ? is logarithmic). As a consequence, using the union bound over a finite.net, we can obtain as a corollary of the above theorem a uniform deviation bound of the.same form over a (discretized) set of functions (where the log-cardinality of the set appears.as an additional factor). For instance, if we consider a 1/n-discretization net of functions.with d parameters, hence of size O(nd ), then the above bounds holds uniformly when replacing the log ? ?1 term by d log n + log ? ?1p.. This does not change fundamentally the.bound (up to an additional complexity factor d log(n)), and justifies that we consider.simultaneously such a family of functions in the main algorithm...h1..h(x)..h2.h3.h4.h5..^.?4..^.?1..I..^.?3..^.?2..^.?5..x..Figure 1: The NGCA main idea: from a varied family of real functions h, compute a family.of vectors ?b belonging to the target space up to small estimation error...3..The NGCA algorithm..In the last section, we have established that given an arbitrary smooth real function h on.b.Rd , we are able to construct a vector ?(h).which belongs to the target space I up to a small.estimation error. The main idea is now to consider a large family of such functions (h k ),.giving rise to a family of vectors ?bk (see Fig. 1). Theorem 1 ensures that the estimation.error remains controlled uniformly, and we can also normalize the vectors such that the.estimation error is of the same order for all vectors (see Comments 2 and 3 above). Under.this condition, it can be shown that vectors with a longer norm are more informative about.the target subspace, and that vectors with too small a norm are uninformative. We therefore.throw out the smaller vectors, then estimate the target space I by applying a principal.components analysis to the remaining vector family..In the proposed algorithm we will restrict our attention to functions of the form h f,? (x) =.f (h?, xi), where ? ? Rd , k?k = 1, and f belongs to a finite family F of smooth real.functions of real variable. Our theoretical setting allows to ensure that the approximation.error remains small uniformly over F and ? (rigorously, ? should be restricted to a finite.?-net of the unit sphere in order to consider a finite family of functions: in practice we.will overlook this weak restriction). However, it is not feasible in practice to sample the.whole parameter space for ? as soon as it has more than a few dimensions. To overcome.this difficulty, we advocate using a well-known PP algorithm, FastICA [8], as a proxy to.find good candidates for ?f for a fixed f . Note that this does not make NGCA equivalent.to FastICA: the important point is that FastICA, as a stand-alone procedure, requires to fix...the ?index function? f beforehand. The crucial novelty of our method is that we provide a.theoretical setting and a methodology which allows to combine the results of this projection.pursuit method when used over a possibly large spectrum of arbitrary index functions f ..NGCA ALGORITHM ..Input: Data points (Xi ) ?

(12-dimensional) data obtained by different algorithms, from left two right: PCA, Isomap, FastICA (tanh index), NGCA. In each case, the.data was first projected in 3D using the respective methods, from which a 2D projection.was chosen visually so as to yield the clearest cluster structure. Available label information.was not used to determine the projections..b Id is the identity matrix, and PI denotes the orthogonal projection.orthonormal basis of I,.on I. In datasets (A),(B),(C), NGCA appears to be on par with the best FastICA method..As expected, the best index for FastICA is data-dependent: the ?tanh? index is more suited.to the super-Gaussian data (B), while the ?pow3? index works best with the sub-Gaussian.data (C) (although, in this case, FastICA with this index has a tendency to get caught in.local minima, leading to a disastrous result for about 25% of the samples. Note that NGCA.does not suffer from this problem). Finally, the advantage of the implicit index adaptation.feature of NGCA can be clearly observed in the data set (D), which includes both sub- and.super-Gaussian components. In this case, neither of the two FastICA index functions taken.alone does well, and NGCA gives significantly lower error than either FastICA flavor..Example of application for realistic data: visualization and clustering We now give.an example of application of NGCA to visualization and clustering of realistic data. We.consider here ?oil flow? data, which has been obtained by numerical simulation of a complex physical model. This data was already used before for testing techniques of dimension.reduction [2]. The data is 12-dimensional and our goal is to visualize the data, and possibly.exhibit a clustered structure. We compared results obtained with the NGCA methodology,.regular PCA, FastICA with tanh index and Isomap. The results are shown on Figure 4. A.3D projection of the data was first computed using these methods, which was in turn projected in 2D to draw the figure; this last projection was chosen manually so as to make the.cluster structure as visible as possible in each case. The NGCA result appears better with a.clearer clustered structure appearing. This structure is only partly visible in the Isomap result; the NGCA method additionally has the advantage of a clear geometrical interpretation.(linear orthogonal projection). Finally, datapoints in this dataset are distributed in 3 classes..This information was not used in the different procedures, but we can see a posteriori that.only NGCA clearly separates the classes in distinct clusters. Clustering applications on.other benchmark datasets is presented in the extended paper [3]...5..Conclusion..We proposed a new semi-parametric framework for constructing a linear projection to separate an uninteresting, possibly of large amplitude multivariate Gaussian ?noise? subspace.from the ?signal-of-interest? subspace. We provide generic consistency results on how well.the non-Gaussian directions can be identified (Theorem 1). Once the low-dimensional ?signal? part is extracted, we can use it for a variety of applications such as data visualization,.clustering, denoising or classification..Numerically we found comparable or superior performance to, e.g., FastICA in deflation.mode as a generic representative of the family of PP algorithms. Note that in general,.PP methods need to pre-specify a projection index with which they search non-Gaussian...components. By contrast, an important advantage of our method is that we are able to.simultaneously use several families of nonlinear functions; moreover, also inside a same.function family we are able to use an entire range of parameters (such as frequency for.Fourier functions). Thus, NGCA provides higher flexibility, and less restricting assumptions a priori on the data. In a sense, the functional indices that are the most relevant for.the data at hand are automatically selected..Future research will adapt the theory to simultaneously estimate the dimension of the nonGaussian subspace. Extending the proposed framework to non-linear projection scenarios.[4, 11, 10, 12, 1, 6] and to finding the most discriminative directions using labels are examples for which the current theory could be taken as a basis..Acknowledgements: This work was supported in part by the PASCAL Network of Excellence (EU # 506778)..Proof of Proposition 1 Put ? = E [Xh(X)] and ?(x) = h(x)??> x. Note that ?? = ?h??,.hence ?(h) = E [??(X)]. Furthermore, it holds by change of variable that.Z.Z.?(x + u)p(x)dx = ?(x)p(x ? u)dx..Under mild regularity conditions on p(x) and h(x), differentiating this with respect to u gives.Z.Z.E [??(X)] = ??(x)p(x)dx = ? ?(x)?p(x)dx = ?E [?(X)? log p(X)] ,.where we have used ?p(x) = ? log p(x) p(x).

In recent years, a number of alternative technologies became available, among them adaptations of the pyrosequencing procedure (i.e. \"454 sequencing\"), promising a ~100-fold increase in throughput over Sanger technology ��� an advancement which is needed to make large and complex genomes more amenable to full genome sequencing at affordable costs. Although several studies have demonstrated its potential usefulness for sequencing small and compact microbial genomes, it was unclear how the new technology would perform in large and highly repetitive genomes such as those of wheat or barley.ResultsTo study its performance in complex genomes, we used 454 technology to sequence four barley Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones and compared the results to those from ABI-Sanger sequencing. All gene containing regions were covered efficiently and at high quality with 454 sequencing whereas repetitive sequences were more problematic with 454 sequencing than with ABI-Sanger sequencing. 454 sequencing provided a much more even coverage of the BAC clones than ABI-Sanger sequencing, resulting in almost complete assembly of all genic sequences even at only 9 to 10-fold coverage. To obtain highly advanced working draft sequences for the BACs, we developed a strategy to assemble large parts of the BAC sequences by combining comparative genomics, detailed repeat analysis and use of low-quality reads from 454 sequencing. Additionally, we describe an approach of including small numbers of ABI-Sanger sequences to produce hybrid assemblies to partly compensate the short read length of 454 sequences.ConclusionOur data indicate that 454 pyrosequencing allows rapid and cost-effective sequencing of the gene-containing portions of large and complex genomes and that its combination with ABI-Sanger sequencing and targeted sequence analysis can result in large regions of high-quality finished genomic sequences..Came to Vic and Anthony\\'s this evening to celebrate my birthday, and I could not have picked a better establishment.

It looks like most of the brands are kept together but where you might be looking at a $300 pair of jeans on one table, there\\'s a $50 pair on the next. Normally I love a good selection, but with this store I just don\\'t get it..Took a trip to Vegas and we had some time to kill before heading out to enjoy the nightlife. We decided to come here as it looked fun and interesting.  All my family had a real good time as we took tons of pictures and had an overall great time. The price was a tad steep but hey its Vegas so it\\'s expected.  Would definitely recommend it for laughs and if you have some free time in between activities..The menu is top notch, especially with the spicy pork. But because of the inefficient ordering and payment methods, you find yourself spending your entire lunch break just getting your food..First time coming to this establishment after hearing great reviews about the quality of chicken they serve here, and was thoroughly impressed!..At first glance, the restaurant was a quaint small-medium sized location with adequate seating. They do also have a nice small patio that would be great for warmer weather. The general vibe was busy but cozy...When it came down to the food, there was 4 of us in total and it did take a while after ordering for the meals to arrive, but honestly I\\'ll overlook it because of how much I really liked the taste of the food and the price. If you\\'re a fan of Brussel Sprouts, I highly recommend the ones they serve as a snack. They add just the right amount of spice to give it a little kick. ..For the main courses, there was the Fried 52 Chicken Sandwich (they change the type of flavour each week). This week\\'s theme was thanksgiving, which had gravy, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. It was AMAZING. The Lightning Hot Chicken Plate was crispy and super juicy, but not too spicy. Finally, the UC Viet Notta \\'Banh\\', I highly recommend. They managed to infuse a nice blend of asian flavour into the sandwich. Once again, the spice level was very manageable and enhanced the overall flavour of meal. They do have sauces on the side for you to add to your chicken if you need but honestly everything was so flavourful...Overall, we loved our meals and will definitely be back again!!.I\\'ve been to this place twice i absolutely love the front desk ladies they go above and beyond exceptionally for the eldery and sickly. They are very kind i never have to much of a wait..This jet cab service is fast and the price is fair. We always call them whenever we need a cab and it\\'s always on time.i definitely recommend this out of any cab service in C-U!.L\\'Oreal Canada has a warehouse sale twice a year. This sale is by invitation only. You will need a invitation ticket that entitled for 2 visits with a friend and total purchase value of $700...The brand that are discounted includes L\\'Oreal, Lancome, Redken, Vichy, Biotherm, Garnier, Maybelline cosmetic, fragrances, skincare and hair care products...Usually products are at least 50% cheaper than what you can get from Department or Drug stores...I would suggest going on a weekday early afternoon and you will have no problem finding parking on location. If you not, you need to park on the sidestreets...They accepts Visa, Mastercard and Interac..I actually really like clothes mentor. I find a lot of really good scores, especially in the jewelry department..Inflated estimates, work not done 100%. Had multiple vehicles in there. 2nd one came back w an extremely high estimate and 911 repairs needed-ended up not being g that extreme once I looked at it..Decor was nice. Be warned if you want to eat at a table as they will ask you to remove any baseball caps. Alternative is to eat at the bar however everyone needs to be 21 years old. ..We sat at a table all the way at the back where you can view the sports betting area. These tables are a bit weird though and best avoided ( see picture) as the have a large mound like bit under the table which you end up having to place your feet on. It feels odd and uncomfortable. Go for the four legged table instead on the lower level...We had spicy peppers cheese dip and blue corn tortillas for started which was excellent! For the main we had medium rare mesa burger. It was good. Caramelized onions, cheese and served with some excellent mustard ( English i think) The fries were great. My brother had the shrimp tacos. He said it was good but it was too pricey for what you get. 6 shrimp, two soft tacos and some salad stuff. Tasty but not worth the price. Best avoided! Would I come back, maybe.  I thought the food was good but did feel it was a bit pricey. It probably deserves 3 1/2 stars..4.5 stars in my books!  Shinobu is exactly what I love in a Japanese restaurant: a homey feel, friendly staff, and fresh & authentic nigiri.  Sure, its decor is basic at best but that\\'s part of its charm.  Volcano roll is proportioned well in terms of rice and sushi deluxe combo is great for two people to share (you won\\'t get two of each piece but it\\'s great value for the amount of food you get).  Their salmon yukke (seared, chopped salmon) is so flavourful and perfectly seasoned.  The staff are always accommodating and allow you to order off the menu; if they\\'re able to fulfill your request, they definitely will.  Once, I called to make a reservation at a certain time but was told there were no tables at that time so I settled for a later dinner reservation - half an hour later, they made the effort to call back and let me know there was availability after all.  Great service!.We have passed this place numerous times and kept saying we should try it, but we were always reluctant, now I\\'m sorry we waited so long.  I thought it had a good atmosphere, pub like without the high noise level.  Everyone was very friendly and the food was delicious.  They also had a great selection of beers on tap.  This will be our new lunch stop, especially when we\\'re going to Costco, it\\'ll add a positive to an otherwise stressful shopping trip..Really friendly staff! When I walked in they immediately greeted me, I love that! I went in to make some copies, and it was really easy and convenient. One of the staff came over and made sure I was doing ok. It was a great experience!.Went there the other day and found the cheesesteak to be so-so. The bread was way too dense and the quality of meat and cheese was good, but there was just not enough of it. They also have Utz potato chips and Tasty Kakes, so if you\\'re a transplanted east coaster, you can get your fix. Also, there is no indoor seating, so it\\'s not really good for lunch on hot days..As previously noted, wait time is unacceptable, no reason to wait for an hour past app\\'t time except for being inept. I agree with a previous writer, I could see staff through the glass on the door & agree they were standing around (no papers in hand) laughing & chatting.....while I waited..Also, to agree with another writer, it seems as tho\\' they \"pad\" the estimate with services that are exorbitant in cost..I do not recommend Banfield but if you DO go there review the estimate with a fine tooth comb, most of the service is probably not necessary..First yelp, thought it would be positive! Went to the linq tonight for the bloq party and went to Chayo for our first stop. I was greeted by Danielle the bartender who offered us 2-1 margaritas as their block party special, they were great! It was a half off taco day but I went with there vegetarian enchiladas which had a good amount of spice to them. As a local I will definitely be back again. Now on to the next experience at the linq..Walmart is my go-to store! But......But the service of their employees at Walmart Photo Supercentre is extremely poor. They should know that customer is the king!..They took pics of my babyboy and the photo specifications were twice wrong. I had to go back and request them to change it which the lady didn\\'t like. No greeting, no apology for the mishap, nothing!..And guess what, no refund either! ..I hope the CEO of Walmart Canada sees this. It\\'s all about the service at the end of the day that makes customers like me come back!..I will continue to shop at Walmart but they just lost me as a customer at Walmart Photo Centre and I will never go there and take pics of me or my family!.The Shiloh really makes you feel like you are home. The food is really good, the beers are varied, tasty and refreshing and the drinks are very moderately priced. I am not from Pittsburgh but I go there often and I always make the Shiloh my first pit stop! ..Do it!.Ice cream is pretty good. Being in Toronto, people would like up for a paper bag and Bang Bang is no exception. In summers? Expect to wait 45-60 minutes to get your fix unless you buy the packaged ice cream from the freezer. They have a variety of cool (heh) flavours and it\\'ll be great to one day try them all...Since it does get so busy though, they should consider not allowing samples during peak periods. It really holds back the line as some people are just too indecisive..I have been going to Ink bomb for the last 9 yrs. I don\\'t get many tattoos very often, but when I get the itch for one I am super happy I found Ink Bomb. Manny is the same tattoo artist I have seen since I started going to ink bomb, he is very professional, courteous and Super Talented!!! All my Tattoos I have gotten are all personalized with his style. I can honestly go in there with a idea and a few days later he sends me a design and lets me customize it any way I want. For the most part everything he has sent me I have absolutely loved and its gone on my skin. The shop is small and super clean, everything used on me has been new out of the packages. My last visit was about a month ago and he did a cover up on my back, I had a old tribal tat that I got in the Army and I thought it was time to upgrade... I was totally worried the old tattoo would show thru or that the drawing and new tattoo just wouldn\\'t cover it up right. After talking to Manny about my idea he made me feel comfortable and confident he knew exactly what he was going to do to get it covered up. It was the first tattoo that I didn\\'t know if I could handle the whole thing done in one sitting, since it hurt that bad. Many was patient like always and he walks you thru the whole tattoo and breaks it down into sections so you don\\'t keep wondering \"damn, how much longer\". This is one of the best things I like about him. If your looking for a shop, check out ink bomb. Ive sent so many family and friends here just for the fact that it is honestly so hard to find a reputable, talented and trustworthy tattoo artist. Im already thinking about whats next......You really cannot beat their extended hours and location...Alta Vista took me and feline companion with alarming eye problem in for a same-day appointment around 9 p.m. and did a good job of making estimates clear and letting me know my options (from low cost to high cost).  Though they were closing up shop soon, I did not feel particularly rushed...The staff was loud, fun and boisterous with each other.  I sat nervously in the waiting area while kitty blood was drawn and read a magazine article about Bonnie Hunt, pictured sitting in the passenger seat of a convertible with her dog at the wheel.  Freaking LOVE Bonnie Hunt...Only one other well-dressed young man with amazing high tops and a tiny pup were there that late, along with some guy whose poodle had just had its ass glands milked; it was excitedly rubbing its distended rectum all over the floor and filled the entire room with a war crime-like foul stench...Doctor M phoned me the next day after lab work was completed and recommended a second test on the existing blood sample.  No leukemia or diabetes, thankfully...I\\'ve been referred to an opthamologist -- the doctor sat at his computer and looked up all the information I needed...Total cost of visit, including medications and lab work: ~$240.Great environment, great staff, and great food! Wish there was better parking. You gotta order The Shit..it\\'s awesome!!.Great place to visit and get acquainted with the Arizona desert.  The trails are easily walkable with enough to see so even the two teenagers I was with didn\\'t get to crisis complain mode (which is a minor victory in itself).  The luminarias are beautiful and it is equally as nice to visit during the day and night..There\\'s a million places for tacos... Is kinda annoying.  Regardless, this place is the only place that I go for tacos. Why? Because the tacos are simply the best. No fancy bullshit foofoo tacos here. Simple fresh delicious. .And they are cheap. Like tacos should be.  No $12 tacos here.  They are 3 bones each.  My favorite is the chicken ones. But they are all good. And sometimes they have featured flavors. Those are always great.  There\\'s sometimes a line. Don\\'t be deterred...it usually goes fast. Don\\'t expect to find a seat if they were busy though..Well first of all the girl who was making my sandwich had straight up lied to me when she said they cant do a footlong sandwich for the fresh deal. Second she said to toast the bread and it still came out soggy. Third of all she almost forgot to give me my drinks after i payed for them. And when i asked for light mayo and mustard she put a whole lot. She was also eaves dropping on my conversation with my friend and had to put her two cents in it. This stores customer service needs to be improved and be better..Went there on the Sunday  \"seafood\" buffet. Great price for a \"seafood\" buffet. But what exactly makes a buffet a \"seafood\" buffet??? The Rio hotel has a \"seafood\" buffet which is about twice the cost of this buffet... But for a good reason - it has hot and cold crab, lobster, fresh juicy oysters, sushi, sashimi, and the list goes on.....The Paradise \"Seafood\" Buffet is nothing more than a standard buffet with fresh oysters and about 3 kinds of sushi added to the menu! It is pretty standard for most buffets to include shrimp and crab legs in their dinner menus. So I suppose if you add some oysters and some sushi in your menu, you\\'re magically upgraded to \"Seafood\" Buffet!..Whoever was in charge of the oysters when I went, didn\\'t rinse them so there was a ton of barnicle pieces and black oyster shell goo all over the place. To makes matters worse, they also stacked the oysters all on top of each other, so you\\'d be sure to taste some of that crunchy shell pieces and goo. Yumm? The oysters themselves were quite good, but the poor preparation lead me to only eat less than a handfull of them. In comparison, I think I ate about two dozen juicy ones at the Rio. As for the sushi... I think it was just a california roll, a shrimp nigiri, and tuna roll. ..So if you\\'re a seafood aficionado, then be ready to be disappointed. If you\\'re a regular buffet eater... Not bad!.We specifically ordered and paid for a 6ft square ornamental iron trellis for our courtyard.  Jesse even came to the house to \\'check it out\\' for placement in installation.  When the trellis arrived, it was two inches short and the legs were not long enough to reach the ground when it was placed on the wall.  The installation crew had to make extensions in order for the trellis to fit as desired.  Our planning and Jesse\\'s visit \\'mostly for naught.\\'.So I come to this location often, maybe twice a week. But as of late something has seriously changed in the management. The serving sizes have became so small it\\'s quite sad to say the least. .They still have a great quality product and the staff is pleasant for the most part, but these portions are a joke. They seriously need to take a look at what\\'s going and change it back to how it was..Just wanted to say the food and atmosphere is great, but the staff need more knowledge on the menu and could be more helpful when you ask basic questions.. But I still would go back :).Came here for happy hour with some friends and was not disappointed!..I ordered the Hawaiian Poke Stack which consisted of shredded carrots and ginger, piled onto the poke which was stacked on top of crispy wontons with a side of sliced avocados. It was very delicious but I still prefer the tradition ahi poke with the bits of nori and chopped onions. The portion was kind of small especially for $13! But thank God it was happy hour. ..My friend ordered the chicken nachos which is more than enough for 1 person. You need like 3 people to help you finish it. The nachos were very crispy and warm and loaded with cheese, tomatoes, beans, salsa and guacamole on the side. We didn\\'t even finish the whole thing, that\\'s how big it was. ..Overall the atmosphere is great, service is great and the food is great. They also have a huge selection of beer :) this is definitely a good get-together spot..I am long past due on this update. Chelsea\\'s emailed me after my first review and asked for additional feedback. I appreciated the outreach and was happy to share what details I could remember. Afterwards, they offered me a generous gift certificate and genuinely seemed to appreciate my feedback. A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal. My friend had the filet and I had the prime rib and both were fabulous. It was a very busy night and we sat at the bar. Service was good and management came to follow-up with us to ask us about our meal when I used my certificate to pay for part of our meal. I was very impressed with Chelsea\\'s efforts to listen to customer feedback and also their attempt to make their customers happy. I will return to Chelsea\\'s and continue to love the guacamole tuna tartar!.Normally I don\\'t give 5 stars, but this place amazed me. I had Joe and he is one of the best masseur I\\'ve ever had. I\\'ve being going to different massage spa around, but I cant find someone like Joe. Joe\\'s massage were direct, accurate, and amazing. I was able to sleep pain free for the past three days. So if you are looking for a great massage in town, this is the place!!! I\\'ll totally recommend Joe. You wont regret!!!.This seat yourself places serves traditional bar food with great prices and good service. My chicken sandwich was juicy and flavorful.  Plus they have crinkle fries! They serve breakfast until 2 and even though we didn\\'t try it, it smelled wonderful.  Plenty of tv\\'s, but because of its popularity parking is tight. We\\'ll be back..This place is a MUST visit. The food is always good and the staff take pride in making sure you are well satisfied. If anything is ever wrong they will correct it immediately. This is a must try. The Lake Shore is wonderful as is the Skinny Omelet they have this wonderful mix with quinwa (sp) and Coconut milk that is to die for. Private meeting space for weekday use is an added plus!.Perhaps won of the WORST hotels I have ever stayed in. I cannot believe this is actually a \"Sheraton\" hotel. I came to his area for a business trip and the room was already booked for me. I was scheduled to stay from Sunday-Wednesday.  Check-In went smoothly. I went to my hotel room and my first impression was, this is really nice. Looks great. After a quick 15 min check and stay, I immediately started to regret my stay. My room was extremely warm. I figured maybe the air wasn\\'t on. Checked the thermostat and it seemed to be on. I could hear the AC running but it was not blowing out cool air. I figured I would give it a few minutes. I then looked around to find the mini fridge. I COULD NOT BELIEVE there wasn\\'t a mini fridge in my room. I checked EVERYWHERE but to no avail. I called down to the front desk and they informed me that they would have to check around with maintenance to see if they could provide one for me. Guess what? Didn\\'t hear back from anyone. I had to call back and finally someone brought one to my room. Back to the Air Condition. IT DID NOT WORK! All the rooms were booked and I had to suffer through the night. I could not believe my stay. I will NOT be going back to this location..This food court is gradually but steadily losing tables and chairs (I guess they are getting broken and not being replaced).  In sections, up to a third of the seating is missing, leaving gaping empty spaces. This sure does not help with the weekday lunch rush!    .The tables are wiped very infrequently. However, they are fond of running a half-sized Zamboni through the middle of the lunch rush cleaning the floors, though. (C\\'mon, really? You couldn\\'t wait until the lunch rush was over?) .I will give them props for one thing... they do a pretty fair job at preventing the hordes of downtown homeless people from soliciting table-to-table. It only happens to me very infrequently, and Security is usually right on them..This review is for the disc golf course. There is now map and the holes are sometimes marked but more not than are. There is an entire homeless community living in the park. Also glass everywhere can\\'t bring a dog here if I wanted..Tableau serves the food for the Tower Suites pool and I LOVE their chicken fingers & fries. I literally stay at the Tower Suites JUST FOR their chicken fingers! It is sooooo crispy and the fries are amazing. The chips with guac and salsa is good too! It comes with a huge portion! ..I have also had the red sangria pitcher and guava margarita blended from the pool menu. Not too memorable..Gotta say, love this place just as much as I did 20 years ago at their Scottsdale location. Thank you consistently great and food! I will be back!!.Like that other guy said, just go. ..Great place to come with friends, delicious food and the staff has always been so friendly..They are legit the most friendly and polite staff that would take the time to explain the menu and explain the options. Great food, check out the fries, they are delicious..Equipment is A+ customer service is terrible. The people at the front desk are extremely rude and disrespectful. Even on the phone they are completely rude. It makes me not want to come here. In addition, i changed banks and needed to update my payment info. I was told on the phone that the person \"did not know how to do it\" and to \"come in and someone SHOULD be able to figure it out\". so that\\'s exactly what i did. They had no idea what i was talking about and said the manager has to cancel my membership. I came in 3 times and tried to call each time before that and no one answered and the voicemail is full. each time no manager was on site, this was 3 months ago and since then i\\'ve been paying the 20 dollar monthly fee. I want out of this gym and i want to advise anyone looking at this review to NOT come here. The tanning beds are rarely open, the staff is completely rude and don\\'t care about your needs, typically on their phones at the front desk or having conversations with coworkers while you\\'re trying to ask them something. I\\'ve only been here a handful of times and there\\'s a reason for that. I want out of my membership because paying for this is ridiculous..don\\'t waste your money on zarkana. i\\'ve seen other cirque du soleil shows and this is the worst of them all. the plot was incomprehensible, the flow of the entire thing was just off, there\\'s too much going on on stage most of the time (sensory overload!), and the fact that it was in a theater as opposed to a circus tent somehow didn\\'t feel right, probably because you don\\'t get to appreciate the performers\\' skills in the same way..Came down from D.C. And really glad we stopped here. The food was really good here. We had the wings half/half. Potato swirl (so much flavor!) chopped pork and finished it with the watermelon sojo. On top of the good food, the ambiance was nice with good music to keep you going. However the best part was the customer service. I was shocked how good this guy Kevin was when helping us with the menu to making us feel at home..Came in with my kids before a Cavs game. They got hotdogs which looked great and they enjoyed. I\\'m on a diet and had the Caesar salad with chicken which is one of the best I\\'ve had. The service was great too. Very happy with the non-Burger options. Hope to be back to try a burger next time..This place is awful, just awful. Couldn\\'t get a drink order right for the entire group, used a half shot of liquor for mixed drinks, and the food was terrible..I love Dr. G. He\\'s patient, kind and caring, and most of all he listens. I feel like he takes his time and always answers my questions thoroughly. Yes, it might take a while to get an appointment but I think Dr. G is worth it. I\\'m very happy to have him as my doctor..This is a great neighborhood hike. If you live in the Anthem area, you are lucky to have this right in your backyard! Literally. ..This first two miles of the trail is fairly easy and offers a mild warm up. You will pass lots of volcanic rock and desert shrub, the vegetation out in the area is so pretty. There are some easy switchbacks along the way as well. Once you hit the ridge line, it does get steeper and there are several spots where you will scramble, with use of hands, and this continues until you hit the summit. The good thing about this hike is there is a trail all the way to the top, so no chance of getting lost. ..The view from the top is amazing. Mt Charleston, Red Rock, Arizona, Lake Las Vegas, perfect view of the entire city. No need for a helicopter tour. And please, everyone pick up after yourself. No one wants to see a dirty kleenex on our pretty trails...Stats:..6.5 miles round trip, up and back.2100 feet elevation gain.Allow up to 4 hours for entire hike, but most should be able to reach the summit in 90 minutes and another 60-90 minutes down. .No need for poles, but if you have them, bring them..Last time I was up, someone had stole the sign in log..I\\'ve been going to smokes religiously ever since it first opened. So glad it\\'s finally in mississauga now too. They had their grand opening today. Staff seems friendly. A bit pricey but worth it. I always get the pulled pork poutine. Good portion size at this location or so it seems at first. But my poutine had a very high ratio of fries to cheese, gravy and toppings. Usually when I mix it in there always enough to coat all or most the fries. About half my box of fries were naked even after mixing everything in so the bottom was just dry and bland fries. Still will be back but hopefully they\\'ve adjusted the portion ratios a bit by then!.The burgers are too thin and too boring to be so expensive. Don\\'t really want my meat to crunch either. I gave it two chances but now I\\'m out..Simply the best Foundations class & instructor ever!  Evelyn was my instructor when I first started yoga at SWIHA & I\\'m so glad I found her again.  If you\\'re new to yoga, or like me & trying to get back in it, than this class is perfect.   Time for the class is great too.  I\\'ve really missed practice & am so glad I\\'m back!.since 2/27/2011 .We always go with our rewards card its only 8.99 for dinner and drinks are only 3 bucks and they always load it up with booze, from the bottle not cheap tap liquor either, it\\'s the best! Their selection is great, their ceasar salad dressing is my favorite and their asian curry noodles and pad thai and dumplings are great! Their decor is really nice and modern too. Service is good. Love it! We are regulars! I can\\'t think of anywhere else I would bother to go. Only thing is its smoky in the casino so your hair ends up smelling like smoke, make sure you have time to shower otherwise you are going to bed with smoky hair!.I love this place!  It is truly a hidden gem in West View.  It is definitely not a fancy place inside, but they more than make up for it with their food.  If you eat in, they have the cutest little ceramic fish that you rest your chopsticks on.  I\\'m not quite sure why I love them so much, but I do!  Take out is also a great option, but make sure you give yourself a little extra time, as they can get very busy on the weekends...I go mainly for their sushi, which is delicious!  Our typical order is spicy tuna roll, crunchy shrimp roll and blue crab roll.  Everything is always fresh and tasty.  They have many options from the simple roll to the more complex rolls.  The samosa appetizer is a fried dumpling like creation with a spicy, potato and onion mixture served with a sweet chili sauce on the side.  The prices are more than reasonable for the product you get.  Usually 3 rolls between my boyfriend and I and were are done! (And I promise we live to eat!)..The service is always polite and friendly.  It is obviously a local, family owned establishment which I always prefer over the big, chain brands.  If you haven\\'t checked out Royal Myanmar yet, then definitely make plans to do so soon!.Really high prices for the quality food. \"La Chica Fresa\" was so disgusting and after telling the waitress it was not good at all and leaving the entire plate untouched minus a bite, the waitress still charged it and didn\\'t really care to make it better. Completely over priced for food that is all fried..A classic homestyle cafe with lots of seating. Price to portion is a super bargain. Prepare to share, cause you won\\'t be able to finish anything by yourself, with 10 in our party we were seated together after a brief wait during which we relaxed in the bar area which has a throwback 60\\'s feel. The booths surround water/ fire pits . Cozy!.Our table ordered omelets,biscuits and gravy, eggs Benedict, French toast, blueberry and cranberry muffins, pancakes, mimosas, Bloody Mary! Rave reviews all around. Gigantic portions, quality ingredients..South Mountain Park is a great place to bring out of town guest.  The reason why I say that is because the view is outstanding.   It is a nice 20 minute drive up the mountain to Dobbins Point.  We came up to Dobbins Point on Saturday with family and it was incredible view when it is clear outside.   Also I found out that this park is the biggest park in the world.  ..If you ever have family or friends in town and want to go for a hiking or just want to see an awesome view of phoenix, you should bring them here.  ..Happy Yelping.  :).we love Hungry Howie\\'s.  never a problem...love the crust.  crew is always nice.  the only thing I did not enjoy was the sandwiches...the \"bread\" was doughy.  the pizza is spot on delicious....love the cinnamon bread too.Worst haircut I\\'ve ever got....was told it was $35 when I scheduled it...by the time I walked out I had dropped $50. I asked for a taper and a clean up but my hair cut looks like all the barber did was cut my sideburns off there is not fade or shade or style to my hair..Expected an experienced barber for such a classy place and especially for the price...Don\\'t get me wrong besides the jacked up haircut the environment and decor of this barbershop is Class so I really wanted to make this my go to spot when I\\'m in town..I brought my two cats in for their yearly checkups and shots today, Dec 8, 2015. The 20 minute wait while the front desk person talked on the phone was annoying  but not the reason I ended up walking out of the office without either of my cats being seen..First off, my younger cat, Frances, a rescue cat had been to their office twice before in this past year,  and I was told they would get her spay records and first year shot records from the Animal Rescue League. I called Greenfield Vet 2 months before  she was due and again a week before I brought her in today to make sure they secured those records. I told the nurse the situation when we went into the exam room and she seemed thoroughly confused. She left the room and said she was going to call the Animal Rescue League and have Frances\\' shot records faxed right over. .About two minutes after she left the exam room, Dr. Winnie came in and right away he was obnoxious and condescending. I asked him what was wrong since he seemed agitated and short-tempered and he rolled his eyes and shook his head as if to dismiss me. After a few curt words, he asked me what shots Frances needed. I told him I was hoping he would know. He left the room in a huff, and at that point, I knew my cats wouldn\\'t be in loving hands, so I picked up both their carriers and walked out of the exam room. Dr. Winnie was was talking to the nurse and I told them I\\'ll just take my cats elsewhere and he yelled out, \"If you figure out what shots she needs....\" and the door closed behind me..Just a week prior, Frances had gone into have blood drawn and the female doctor stuck the needle right through her vein and out the other end. .NEVER again will I take any animal to Greenfield Veterinary Hospital..Great place for greek food.  Tasty & authentic. The greek salad was fresh & crisp, the gyros were delicious.  The spanakopita was good too. :).I really like Laredo\\'s.  This location is nice but not fancy.  I usually only get 1 thing there and thats the Burrito La Roqueta.  It is amazing.  There are some days that are better than others but overall, it\\'s pretty much a winner for me.  I also really enjoy the Queso dip and the tortilla chips.  I request their spicy sauce and dip my chip in both the Queso dip and spicy salsa.  It\\'s a fantastic combination!.Tom and Shannon are the best landlords ever! My girlfriend and I have been living at their uptown apartment for one year and have had nothing but good experiences. We feel lucky to have found the space when we did..Was actually delicious--a little greasy/oily but nonetheless delicious. BUT, my wife and I both ended up with some food poisoning. ..About 2 hours after eating, my wife started throwing up and then my stomach started gurgling. I have it a little more time; maybe my wife was just sick for some reason. Then it was my turn. ..Really too bad. I wanted to like this place as tonkotsu ramen is one of my favourite dishes on the planet after having lived in Kanto for three years..Was here tonight.  It is OK!  Not much Irish things on the menu, more of a bar food type joint.  Potatoe skins were meh.  The paddy o melt was meh too.  The live music was a plus..Okay, I realize that most people LOVE this place so my 3 stars is going to be frowned upon BUT I must admit that I\\'m not a huge pizza fan and the service was far from good...We decided to try Grimaldi\\'s late on a Saturday night.  The hostess was quick to seat us in a half empty restaurant.  Our waitress waited 8 minutes before stopping by our table.  She said she would be right back to take our drink order.  Approximately 10 minutes later she returned and said that she was so sorry and stated that they were so busy.  As I look around I notice that more then half the tables are empty and I see numerous waitresses.  Oh well, maybe she was new.  She brings our drinks by quite some time later and apologizes again.  I can\\'t stand when people keep saying sorry with no meaning behind it!  If you\\'re sorry, change what you are doing!!  Eventually we got some food!!..Pizza - you choose your toppings for every pizza which range from $2 a piece to $4 a piece.  You can easily make a $30 pizza.  It\\'s thin crust and it was eh!..I ordered white Sangria which was different!  It kind of tasted like moscato and sprite with a slice of orange. ..The only pizza I really enjoyed was Pizza Fusion and they are gone! :\\'( I would try other pizza places before I came back here..The show was really good. Before we walked in, we asked about drinks because we were thirsty. The guy said that there was a waitress inside and she would come around and take our drink orders. We\\'ll she never came around so for that I give it 3 Stars..Food was not good. I had the \"smoked\" beef dip and my partner had the po\\' boy. What little beef my sandwich had was dry and flavourless. It was covered in a very strong cheese which would have been nice on its own but we terrible with the beef. The au jus was pretty much just salt. The only redeeming thing was the salad which had some nice house made pickled veg. My partners po\\' boy was just as bad. The fish didn\\'t seem to have any seasoning at all and she could hardly eat it because of all the sauce making it fall apart. It\\'s a shame the food was so bad because our service was great and they have a nice drink selection. I\\'d go back for drinks but not food..I attended here a while back, it was not really for me.seemed like everyone was a little stuck up..The equipment was ok and the place is really clean..The beet salad is a must have! Looking for a special meal? You will find it here. Not the usual casino fare. Fine dining at its best. Pricey but worth it!.Dunwellz reminds me of that episode of Southpark where they had a restaurant called Raisins ... it was ran by kids and all the customers were kids... it\\'s sad that you try to enjoy your night out on a Friday at 12 at night and literally the whole place is filled with high school kids... I won\\'t be stepping back in this place until they make some rules about allowing kids after hours... shame.It is true the interior design of this restaurant is very well done, impressive use of lights to highlight the bright colours..The service was good, as we were party of eight we had the attention of more then one person..The food is delicious, the peanut butter dumplings and the crispy spinach are my favourite. I\\'m a salad freak: the papaya, mango, house salads are well sized and perfectly dressed. There is a testing menu that is all you can eat and the list of dishes you can pick from is impressive..Beware of the tasting menu delays. The food comes late and you need to remind about your order. Whoever ordered a la carte received the food on time, but for some of my friends the waiting for their tasting menu choices was too much..Small things that matter: rest rooms are not clean by the end of the working hours and cigarette smell as soon as the kitchen closed..Man, this places been around for over 15+ yrs. it started off as a mom and pop shop kinda Resturant with 6ish tables around the corner before time square was ever built...This place never disappoints. It\\'s always very yummy, super quick and service is consists to above average...Breakfast, lunch and dinner set are very reasonable in price!..Just remember to bring a hoodie or sweater before entering. They like to have AC cranked UP...Food (Taste): 4.5/5.Food (Presentation): 4/5.Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 5/5.Service: 4/5.Ambiance: 4/5.Fun Factor: 3/5.Love the location, love the staff, everything is great about the Bulldog Pub. The prices aren\\'t crazy expensive especially for the food, and unlike other bars in Pittsburgh, we never get stuck waiting for hours at a time. Grateful to have something like this in our neighborhood..Descriptive phrase: das a big boot...Came for the Boot, stayed for the Boot...Get some friends, sit outside in their biergarten or inside in the kitschy old German bierhall. Order a real German beer in a glass boot. Proceed to play the game...You\\'ll get drunk, you\\'ll eat lots of free popcorn, you\\'ll laugh, you\\'ll glub, you\\'ll love it..Good food at a reasonable price. I am always leary of chain restaurants but this place was good. Sat at the bar and enjoyed a margarita pizza and a glass of Pinot Grigio..Really loved this restorand, the food, the service, the ambiance. You feel like you\\'re in Japon..Thank you...Nous avons bien aimé ce restaurant. Les plats sont très jolis, savoureux et typiquement japonais. Une belle découverte à Montréal et une place que je n\\'hésiterais pas à proposer à des amis..Merci.It\\'s a good store, with a huge selection and wide open spaces.  The employees are always friendly and helpful.  Pricing on some items is pretty steep, but not completely crazy.  The store layout is pretty nice and allows you to browse and touch most of the stuff..I gotta say, I returned here and was disappointed this last time.  Lobster was chewy and crab was not very good.  I was really disappointed, actually.  They have the gelato for dessert which is nice but other than that, there was not much else impressive about desserts.  I don\\'t know why, but this place is not like I remember.  Quality has really gone down from before.  Mexican, Asian and Middle Eastern food were not good -- I mean, nothing special about them.  In the sushi bar -- sashimi was only thing decent.  All other rolls were really generic.  ..Too bad, I\\'d always enjoyed coming here.  =(.Since moving here two years ago from the Bay Area I haven\\'t sound a good Dominican stylist until TODAY! I had a gorgeous blowout ang my hair was so shiny, full and bouncy when I left. I received so many compliments. Kat really knows no-racial hair and can work with any hair type. Tough hair is her speciality. You would t be disappointed!.best place for your weekend needs!.A trip to Vegas doesn\\'t seem complete without one of these boozed up frozen treats.  While it\\'s nice to walk that fine line between tourist and local, there is nothing local about walking up and down the strip with ginormous cup of alcoholic slurpee. With that said, I\\'ve been going to Vegas for years and love exploring off the strip to realize there is more to this city than hotels and casinos.  But I am also reminded of the foolishness that awaits with that first visit to Fat Tuesday as well..It\\'s a cozy little café on the southwest corner of Bloor and Borden St, they offer a great selection of  both hot and cold tapas that you can share - all for under $10.  ..In addition to that, they have a decent selection of 48 different teas that  that are of the black, green, herbal, white and rooibos tea variations that you can try out and share with your date...During the warmer months of the year they have a spacious patio to soak up the sun while conversing over the hum of city sounds..This is one of those amazing places that could easily be overlooked.  For more than 14 years, the owners of Cafe Forte have tirelessly made a name for themselves by providing unadulterated cuisine or comfort foods for folks who like their meals freshly made with only quality ingredients.  .BRAND NEW Comfort Hours from 3-5pm features awesome appetizers like their roasted Polenta cakes!  They also feature $4 glasses of select wines and beers, too!.One of their signature dishes is the Cafe Meatloaf with a light burgundy sauce and smashed potatoes.  They also feature many fresh seafood entrees as well as fine Italian specialties..Because the restaurant is located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale,  on Main Street, just east of Goldwater Blvd,  you can enjoy the works of fine artists as well as the fine foods at Cafe Forte..I recommend  beginning your meal with the baked brie and sliced apples along with a nice Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand..Casual atmosphere with little votives and a fresh flower on each table is what you will see when you first enter the main dining room.  There is a bar area and when weather permits, an intimate garden for romantic dining.  They also do amazing pies and tortes for dessert..Great for dinner on Thursday Artwalks or for a casual lunch with good friends!.We had been taking things to Delight Cleaners for as long as they have been there. They are convenient, and generally, they do okay work...I recently took a pair of pants in to be hemmed. They seemed okay, but after a week, the hem started to come undone, and so I took them back and asked that they be redone...When I came to pick the pants up, they had not been redone. The person told me that the seamstress had said, \"These are not my stitches,\" and that she would not redo them...I was flabbergasted. They acknowledge that they have a charge for one pair of pants and that they did, in fact, hem a pair of pants for me. But they insist that they did not do that particular pair of pants...It all seems pretty irrational to me. In the end, they grudgingly redid the pants, but unfortunately, in taking out the previous stitches, they tore the pants and had to patch the tear, and the pants now look terrible...Will not be going back..05.10.08: I was really suprised at some of the reviews of this place. The casino is alright that is true. But the place is beautiful. The sky image, the little shops and designs makes the place very cute. ..The rooms are comfortable. So much so that I was about to ask the front desk people what brand is the mattress. I have lower back pains and well this is the first time in a long while I woke up two days in a row without any pain. Heaven mattress...I like the fact that my room had a separate shower from the bathtub. The swimming pool was alright but getting service while ur lounging is wonderful. Getting first class service. ..There is some downer tho, but its little stuff such as their food. Its alrigth there I rather go to the buffet other places but thats the best part about vegas people do go other places. duh. You don\\'t want to spend all day at the same hotel. ..Oh yeah and the greatest thing about this place in the room is their white tea lotion. OMG i love their lotion it smells so freaking good. Just bathe me in it please. ha ha.....Well thats about it about this place come and try it out if you want.. Actually you should just come because I said so..Same food as the original location on Maryland Parkway, just a newer feel and more middle-eastern appearance.  Hookah is a must, so yea, I dig it!.Quickly becoming a favourite place of mine, but you have to get there early to avoid the lunch time rush.  I think I\\'ve had the california bowl or something a few times.  I\\'m too un-advernturous to try something else.  I need tuna and avocados in my life.  Sometimes they go pretty heavy with the spicy mayo.  I should totally get that on the side.  Maybe next time.  It\\'s really tasty though and the portion sizes are pretty reasonable..I buy my kids uniforms here and they always have what I need. Prices are average. The service is good too..I was actually quite impressed by this airport.  Two things stood out for me:  their free wi-fi, which was surprisingly fast for being free; and the fact that they have restrooms (with personal attendants, which is a little weird at first) like every twenty feet.  Very nice place if you have to have a longish layover, or have a small bladder.  One of these days, I want to sit in one of those white rocking chairs they have in the main concourse, right across from the NASCAR store..food was way too salty for pf changs. stopped in for lunch and it took a long long time to get our food. they also forgot soup..I was a long time and loyal customer after I moved to Vegas 2 1/2 years ago and I went to this restaurant numerous times until when I start seem HUGE cockroaches. First time was my ex boyfriend came to visit so I intent to gave him a better impression after he dumped me so we sat at the sushi bar then he pointed at the wall and show me the HUGE cockroaches walking on the wall slowly across the bar, I was so stun but since I was such a LOYAL customer, I did not mentioned to the owner. I mentioned to the owner next time when I was there then the owner just looked at me for couple minutes and saying if NEXT TIME if I happen to see again, he will give me 10% off. WHAT?  NEXT TIME? he forgot how many times I already been there after all these 2 1/2 years? I mentioned to another management next time and got the same respond. I decide not to go this restaurant anymore. 1 month ago, I brought one of my new friend there for lunch then we saw the cockroaches again. I mentioned to the server that the reason I stop coming here because the cockroaches and now here\\'s again and the owner\\'s attitude. She did not do anything either. Couple days ago, I went to the restaurant tried to order the lunch special and I got there at 5PM sharp and the owner was calculating the total bill for the others and not even look me for a second, after couple minutes passed, he said the lunch was over at 5PM but I got there at 5PM, he did not even look at me. ..I swear in my life that I would NEVER going to step into this restaurant again after I waste my life at here for more then 2 years. Isn\\'t the customer service most important for the Japanese restaurant?..It\\'s a pricy place and noisy and crowed place, just not sure why so many people go there for? You won\\'t have a quality time for easily paying over $80+ for 2 people. The moist important is there\\'s no SERVICE at all. The owner\\'s attitude is even worth to hell. Don\\'t get me wrong, I already ordered lunch special for over 50 times and their food has no problem at all but the owner is that kind of person since he sees so many customer coming up to the store, he forgot what\\'s called SERVICE and APPRECIATION. He\\'s taking for granted especially for a long term customer. ..Not only this restaurant is dirty, noisy and crowed and you have to wait for at least 1 hour in the night and also you will for sure join the dinner with the other insects if you are still want to go. Good luck for the people who still going...I am terribly upset right now when I am writing this post. I wish I had never spend that much money & time to this restaurant in my life..Our hotel recommend this place for breakfast. We ate here 4 days in a row. The steak and eggs were excellent. Meat was tender and the pancakes are fluffy. Everything we had was excellent. We would recommend this place for breakfast. Every server was nice and friendly..Great biscuits and apple butter.  Pulled pork queso dip was amazing, but we all know queso is always amazing no matter what.  I put three stars because the food seems overpriced and our avocados were rock solid.  Might go again but not any time soon..Saturday was my 1st visit to Southwest & heard the services were really Good!! Oh Boy I got the worst Student name Natalie. The facial & massage was not beneficial to me she seem very timid & ask her several time to please add pressure & be firm. That didn\\'t happen. She acted as if she was scared I was so Irritated & want to walk out & leave. I address this with front desk & she gave me discount & apologize..I discovered this place from a friend.  Damn her!  This place is legit.  The cakes are amazing!  The chocolate cake was amazing. It has a interesting flavor in addition to the chocolate.  The frosting is light and beautiful.  They had all kinds of eclairs...some with whipped cream filling and some with custard.  The macaroons are cake like.  They were okay for me, but my husband and daughter liked them a lot.  I loved the meringues.  The mint tasted like toothpaste( not great..and weird), but the vanilla is amazing.  I haven\\'t tried the bread, but they were sold out of some things, which is probably a good sign.  They close for 3 weeks in the summer.  We discovered this just before they closed. We will come back here again and again when we celebrate special occasions and when friends and family visit.  The prices are low compared to a lot of places. I liked the weird mannequins which some people stated they didn\\'t like.  I guess they have a restaurant, but I have no idea what that is like because I just came for the deserts..This little Venezuelan beauty in the heart of little Italy is a must! People stop and stare because it is out of the ordinary. The arepas are perfect. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, and that\\'s short of the blend of flavors. Don\\'t leave without trying their cachapas. Their service is impeccable..Everything I\\'ve ordered has been hot, fresh and amazing. You have to try the poke. The serving is a good size and flavourful..We always enjoy playing Grayhawk.  We try to catch the specials they post when you register your email with them.   They are a good option in the  North End  of the city..Friendly, clean, seemingly healthy and very filling. I stopped for lunch at The Tasty Bowl, which is just off South Tryon on Weestinghouse. Subs and rice bowls on the menu, I decided on the chicken bowl with sweet and sour pineapple on top of brown rice. When my name was called a few minutes later, a major amount of lunch was ready...A little sweet but tasty with flavor and lots of chicken. Crisp and crunchy vegetables and the rice was very soft. I cleaned the bowl...As I was leaving, the owner sincerely apologized for not being available to make a recommendation. I don\\'t know why - this was great!.Absolutely outstanding food. You have to try the bumpus sandwich. The local history here is cool too. This was the place where the producer cut a check to the owner of the house for the christmas story..These folks are a real anomaly in the auto repair industry.  They are extremely honest, professional and reasonably priced.  They NEVER try to sell me anything.  All of the Yelp five-star reviews are well-deserved.  I drive past a hundred other shops to get here and I will never go anywhere else!!.Not too much good to say about this location other than I had one of the managers basically yelling at me after I purchased a car from here and took it back because it had a problem. (Beware: Once you buy from them you are of no concern anymore).The problem unfortunately did not get fixed, and these people need to find another industry to be in if they wish to treat people that way..Sad to say, for your own good, and mental well - being please avoid this location, there are other dealerships out there that will treat you with common courtesy and respect you deserve, even if it is not the answer you are looking for..I will be reporting the manager who treated me so terribly to nissan head quarters and please, do not give people like this your time or business. Lesson learned..Their prime rib medium rare is HEAVENLY! Why would I go to some of the over priced steak house when I got Ellis Island!? This is my new fav spot...P.s. Kitchen mixed up my order and gave me a medium well initially - they replaced it and gave me a double cut. Twice the heavenly good taste~.1 Ticket for the movies + appetizer in here $19.99..1 huge sapporo + 3 appetizers $12 something..We were on the mall after a Sephora scale, without coffee, breakfast, or anything else but a spoon of olive oil with lemon in our empty stomachs. So, while passing through the electric steps that point towards the food court, I guess the smell of food invaded Mateo and he asked me if we should grab some food and leave grocery shopping for tomorrow... ..We jumped on the electric stairs thinking where to go eat; I suggested to go look around the fast food but Mateo mentioned in the entrance of this place that in there we could get a cold beer... I just followed hm with the konnichiwa greating while we were entering...This day I finally felted the Spring, so I wasn\\'t in the mood for sweating more in a soup. We ordered calamari, salmon salad, and Mateo ordered a spicy ramen...Everything was average but the size of those sapporos...  I mean, if you are waiting for the movies, loosing time, or you want a neutral place to hook up with someone unknown, this place is open; dynamic; convenient; loud; and if you don\\'t like your date, the washrooms are far away, so you can run.....I love the sealing of this spot with all those red flowers, reminded me one of those beautiful Kenzo commercials..let me just start by saying, Tibet Kitchen is the only restaurant I would gladly drive from Mississauga to Toronto just to get my dose of momos and chicken pakoras! Service is excellent, everybody makes you feel welcome once you arrived. Amazing food, can\\'t get enough! I always order their momos, chicken pakoras and chili chicken, highly recommend them!.1st time customer and I know for a fact I will be back. Everything from customer service by Mark, the Store Manager was beyond excellent. To having my oil changed and tires rotated and getting my car ready to go within an hour. The price to top it off was amazing. This place is very trust worthy and you don\\'t have to worry about being up sold by a scumbag mechanic. I honestly cannot say enough about this Goodyear. Thank you for making my experience great! Mark thank you for taking care of me. You now have one loyal customer!.Excellent Personal size Pizza with unlimited toppings for $8..Self service and the restaurant is clean & well maintained. I would definitely recommend this place for casual & quick dining..Their prices are great and so is their food. I\\'ve had their doubles and I was impressed. The woman at the front is very friendly and quite funny. Their pepper sauce is so good. I recommend getting the jerk chicken Roti with pumpkin (extra charge of $2, I think) but it\\'s well worth it..I was SO excited to both go here and subsequently post about this on Yelp!  I remember seeing the episode of Man VS. Food when he went here about 7-8 months ago and I told myself that the next time I\\'m in Vegas, I\\'m going here!  Well, I did, and it didn\\'t disappoint in the slightest!..My wife and I ordered one pancake, which is basically the size of a manhole cover.  I really wish we hadn\\'t ordered it because there was no way we were going to finish the dish that came next, the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  When the waitress brought the dish, we had people looking and even asking what the heck this thing was.  It was HUGE!  Fortunately, the actual size matched the size of its taste!  I can\\'t say I\\'ve ever had fried chicken or chipotle sauce in the morning, but it was very good...It was a great experience and will most likely become a long-standing tradition every time we visit Vegas!.At Vegas for the first time and although I foresee and thoroughly expect rudeness,degenerates and blatant alcoholics to come my way; I have never experienced such rudeness as I have literally JUST experienced from a customer service attendant( to whom I asked a simple question; \" where can I find the restroom\". ) to which she responded, \" I\\'m pointing at it, can\\'t you read, it says \"\" restroom\"\"\", to which I responded \" oh I\\'m sorry, I\\'ve never been here, so you could\\'ve just said \" around the corner and to the right\". ..Vegas is designed to distract you from EVERYTHING, plus, you\\'re given comp drink for gambling. I\\'m sorry if I\\'ve been enjoying my vacation. How about just say, \" hey, it\\'s down this hall and to the right.\" I\\'ll find it eventually. .No need to insult me or my intelligence because I am far more sober than most of these people. .The end. Thank you. ..\"Norma\" was her name. Avoid her..Best dosa restaurant in the GTA..truly lives up to is name! I have been visiting this place for the past couple years and it has been consistently good. They have great combo specials which include an idli and vada appetizer, two dosas, and a pop. It is really affordable compared to other dosa restaurants. The specials run every day even on weekends before 6 pm. .The service is friendly and fast. Each dosa comes with three different chutneys and a bowl of sambhar. You can request for more chutney if you like a particular one and the staff will happily bring it out to you. It is worth driving to Brampton just to have the dosa here. This is my go to place for south Indian food and I can see that it will be in the foreseeable future..Was in Wisconsin so I figured I would check it out. Ordered a 5 piece wing at the take out window. Waited for 25 minutes before I asked for a manager and asked to credit me. So I guess I\\'ll never know. Oh well no big loss!.This is by far the absolute worst Best Buy I have EVER been to.  I had called Virgin Mobil this morning to see about switching from Verizon to Virgin, and they instructed me I could look online for the closest retailers.  Best Buy was one of the most convenient retailers near me so I went in, security directed me straight ahead to the mobile area.  Four male employees all were in a group and not a single one offered to help me.  I stood around about ten minutes before anyone approached me.  Ironically the only Best Buy employee assisting a customer, named Robert, is the one who asked if I could be helped and he had to ask a different Best Buy rep to assist me.  Robert seems to be the only person in this Best Buy who is working and knows what is going on.  Once Alan started assisting me ONLY because he had been directed to, one of the first words out of his mouth was that he didn\\'t know how to \"do that,\" and had to go interrupt Robert to help me.  My confidence dwindled further as I prayed Robert would finish with his customer to help me.  Eventually Robert was finished and unfortunately Virgin this morning told me wrong information (that I could use my Samsung Galaxy for their service) so I left empy-handed.  Not only did I leave with no purchases but I left with a TERRIBLE taste in my mouth of Best Buy.  I had no idea how awful customer service in these stores were.  They had PLENTY of staff but they all just were talking with each other or wandering around.   How can Best Buy afford to pay so many teenage guys to do nothing all day?  I surely would go to WalMart or anywhere else if I ever need a television, a dvd, a phone plan, etc in the future..This is one busy place. An still had a good attitude even late at night thanks guys. No matter what was ordered from everybody else always got orders correct great job.OK let me start with MONICA IS AMAZING!!!!! I have been to many salons in California and Nevada and she is the BEST!  She knows her stuff! As a business owner, you can tell when someone loves what they do! She took her time and let me tell you I was very happy with my manicure. She is a very sweet girl, I already booked my next visit back!! :) Thank you Monica!!!.The flavors were very authentic and the place is hip and exciting. The mushroom tacos were the best tacos on the menu. We also got the Huevos Rancheros which was interesting and a nice brunch dish..The best burgers and fries I\\'ve had in a very long time. Also, I love their soft drinks, particularly the blueberry soda, although my only complaint is that one time, the lemonade ran out of syrup/concentrate and was extremely watered down, but other than that it is amazing..So, yelp page says open until 8pm. Drove all the way here. Employees inside with door unlocked and signage blinking \"open\". Told me they were closed. I stated their yelp page said hours until 8pm today. Assuming the owner, blamed his wife for setting up the page and said the other location was open until 8pm. Bad service, bad attitude. I\\'m really looking for a good sandwich shop. I come from a great city that has much better food than Las Vegas, and I was hoping this would be the place, but I won\\'t be going back..Terrible and slow service. How do you fail a Gyu-Kaku? You\\'re barely cooking. You literally have to give us raw meat. And you fail that? ..We ordered the combo for 2 people... the food was great, no problem about the food (I cooked most of it anyways) but the service was absolutely terrible. The guy was nice but being nice doesn\\'t get you too far if you can\\'t do your job. ..We didn\\'t get our waters refilled NOT ONCE. I ended up drinking my sons water in his kid cup because I didn\\'t have water. We needed forks for the kids, asked for forks, he forgot.. we asked again... he forgot again. We ended up walking to the kitchen and asking for forks. ..It took about 15-20 min to bring our meats out... we were the only ones in the restaurant. It wasn\\'t like they were busy. How is it gonna take long to bring out raw meat on plates? ..Then we asked for a second round of meat halfway through our meal, and they didn\\'t come out until we were ready to leave. We ended up canceling the meat. ..Our edamame came to our table about 5 minutes before we left. Our food was eaten already. EDAMAME IS AN APPETIZER. How can you not even bring edamame on time??? ..We won\\'t be back. At least not to this location..I am in college and love coming to this place. Affordable and amazing food. This place is legit in atmosphere and food. Love the giant burritos and horchata..Completely disgraceful, being a server I understand everyone wants to go home but really? We came in AN HOUR before closing.  Waited for 5 mins while the 2 people at the bar made it clear they didn\\'t want us there by blatantly ignoring us.   Finally the hostess emerges and tried her hardest to discourage us from seating in the restaurant by offering the lounge which we thought over and decided that wouldn\\'t be best for us.  Only to be replied to with \"it\\'s technically the same thing\" no it\\'s not and that a tad bit rude.  I would never make a guest feel uncomfortable or unwelcome, perhaps the staff would benefit from guest service training.  We left because it\\'s clear an HOUR before closing isn\\'t appropriate time to have dinner..So I recently went to West for the first time on a nice sunny afternoon with a few girlfriends. We went with intentions of enjoying the sun on the patio...I must first say that the patio is very nice indeed! It gets lots of sun and has walls up that block out the wind. There is plenty of comfortable seating as well as ample heat lamps and umbrellas if needed. ..My complaint with West though is its pretentiousness. It gives off a very cold vibe and has a way of making a person feel somewhat insecure. Also it seems to be confused as to if it wants to be classy or trashy cause its a mixture of both. The de core and menu are on the classy side and they seem to attract a lot of the buisness crowd. Yet there were many trashy things going on at the same time . A lot of the servers were wearing bikini tops and some of them were even bouncing around in a kiddie pool bouncing a beach ball back and forth. There was also a male staff member wearing only swim trunks and water wings running around spraying vodka into peoples mouths with a water gun.....Nothing wrong with any of that but if you want to be that type of bar then be that type of bar. Don\\'t pretend to have class...However I must add that all of their slushy drinks on the menu were absolutely delicious..Prior to purchasing the Gutterdome shields from Gutterdome, I had confidence in the Southeast Gutterdome company believing they would be a reliable company that would provide good customer service and stand by their work. After my residential Gutterdome shields installation on 4/13/18,  I paid in full over $2K to Gutterdome. During the first rain after my gutterdome installation, I noticed excessive rain draining underneath my gutters and leaking into my crawlspace. After several attempts to contact the General Manager Robert Sxxxx for Gutterdome, he has responded back to me by email on four separate times giving me specific dates that he was going to have a technician come out to my residence and fix this issue. No one has shown up to my residence. I have sent several more emails with photos and made several phone calls to the Gutterdome Company, pleading and pleading to have a technician come out to my residence and fix this major water leakage that will potentially cost me future unnecessary expense to address the water in my crawlspace. When I call the Gutterdome Company, no one will answer any of the telephone numbers that are listed on their website. You get voice recordings Even after leaving pleading voice messages, I still have not received a return phone call from Gutterdome. I have been very professional with all of my email communications and recorded phone messages. I have done and followed all of the required procedures and guidelines that are outlined in the Gutterdome agreement contract. Gutterdome company provides terrible customer service and operating mis-leading customers with deceptive service requests and breaching their contact.. I now have to hire and pay another gutter company to come out to my residence to fix my leaking gutter issue that I paid a lot of money to Gutterdome.. I had confidence that this Gutterdome Company would stand by their work. My issue that was caused by faulty Gutterdome shield installation should have been honored and fixed by this Gutterdome Company. .FUTURE CUSTOMERS BEWARE!!! THIS COMPANY WILL NOT HONOR REQUEST FOR SERVICE, THAT IS SPELLED OUT IN THIER CONTRACT AFTER YOU HAVE PAID IN FULL YOUR MONEY..Food 4/5.Service 4/5.Atmosphere 5/5..Food: came with four girlfriends, shared four dishes..1. Thursday special: grilled lamb rack. Best dish of the night, lamb wasn\\'t too gamey and went very well with the assorted julienned veggies..2. Malfalde ai funghi (recommended by our server): pretty good, barely any mushrooms but a lot of truffle oil, so the aroma was great..3. Rigatoni bolognese: average, nothing special. Pasta was made a little overcooked, which I preferred. So for people who like their pasta al dente, it may be too overcooked for you..4. Polpette pizza (meatball, mozzarella, smoked provolone): a little difficult to eat because its thin crusted. It\\'s the type of pizza you have to fold to eat, but it was hard because there were chunks of meatballs on it. The taste was good, but I probably wouldn\\'t order again...Service:.Went on a Thursday night, wait was 45 minutes when we went at 8. There\\'s a bar upstairs where you can get drinks while waiting. Our server was nice, but she didn\\'t tell us the specials right off the bat. There was a special for white wine. $1 an ounce of wine on Thursday, which is always nice for a girls night out. But we wouldn\\'t have known if we didn\\'t ask about it ourselves. They were very patient with us though when we asked for recommendations. Although, her recommendations weren\\'t that helpful. She seemed to just have recommended everything we picked already, but we needed help picking an extra dish...Atmosphere:.Loud but romantic. The venue opens up to the patio area. The space isn\\'t big, even a little crowded but it\\'s decorated with walls of wine. We sat on the patio, which was more quiet. However, it was really dim outside. A little extra lighting to look at our food would have been nice. Inside is more lit and appropriate for a romantic date. ..Would definitely come back for drinks and to enjoy the atmosphere. Wouldn\\'t necessarily come back for the food..Chase is a loving & charming individual with an insight like no other reader I have ever been to ! You will be amazed at his readings. I highly recommend Chase for anyone looking for clarity or insight into their situation. I will be going back to Chase.Better than expected! Cool interior and nice service. We had several dishes and everything was tasty. Yes it\\'s a bit pricey, but if you are looking for a fancy brunch or dinner in Las Vegas, I think this place will satisfy you. I made a reservation in advance, but it wasn\\'t too crowded for weekdays..These guys are awesome! Great work in amount of time. I had to get my rear bumper fixed because of a fender bender and the other driver\\'s insurance took care of it. It took a while to get the ball rolling, but that wasn\\'t because of Gerbers.  On the first visit, the guy that handled my account took pictures of the damage for the estimate. Then when all was approved my second visit, I dropped off my car.  The guy circles the damages with a green marker and circles other damages not for the accident in red. He offered to fix other dents I had for additional price. Why not? I\\'m already here..Enterprise was a few steps away and I got a rental while my car was in shop, quoted me 3 days...My car was done in 2. ..Gerber thank you!.They also washed my car!.There really are not many revolving sushi places in Toronto, so this makes for a very interesting experience.  Instead of a conveyor belt they have boats that float around the sushi bar.  The selection on the boats is a basic assortment of sushi roll pieces, sashimi and some other miscellaneous items.  Although I went with a platonic friend, I would highly recommend this place for a date night.  It is definitely an interactive dinner...We went on a weekday for dinner and found that the place was quite busy, which means that the food on the belt was fresh.  The plates on the belt ranged from about $3-$6, and it was nice to be able to immediately start grabbing the dishes and not having to wait for the service to come around...I\\'m not impressed with the dessert menu, I think they could have more Japanese desserts.  I skipped over their selection of cheesecakes and other generic western desserts..Not quite as superb as the stand-alone restaurants [http://www.yelp.com/biz/primanti-brothers-pittsburgh#hrid:C30sebXtI6ykCBDwI0b1ew], but that shouldn\\'t be a surprise. The cheesesteak felt like it had been made an hour earlier and partially re-heated, but still tasted like you hope it should. And it certainly beats your other options at the ballpark-- lukewarm frankfurter, anyone?.Great experience last night at Burgr. We were thoroughly impressed with the food and service. Our waiter, Ryan, did a fantastic job even though he was getting hammered with tables. We had an American burger which was awesome. The 28 day aged burger was the BEST I had ever had. It was cooked perfectly. We had the truffle fries which were amazing as well. We split Shake #4 and it was absolutely fantastic. We were thoroughly impressed with the entire visit and will be back in the future..One thing that upsets me, when they don\\'t change bed sheets, how can one can sleep on on a bed where an who slept before! Look at the pics..Great food. Cooked to order .Ordered on Yelp , but they didn\\'t have my order in the system . No problem . I just reordered on spot..I love fresh food rather than food under burger lamps! .I ordered fresh salt & pepper shrimp ..& chicken fried rice .10 mins before closing . Employees did not give me any grief & were still friendly ..The cashier didn\\'t know what yelp was and I wanted to redeem my free seaweed salad so he told me to download the order delivery apps like foodora.. ?? He was so confused never heard of yelp before. I just told him to forget it I\\'ll just use it next time... I feel like their staff aren\\'t knowledgeable with yelp this is sad. Food is fine though.The last time I was here, I almost wanted to cry just from the sheer frustration of trying to find the exit out of this sardine can...The decorations I will say is beautiful.  There are beautiful flowers floating on the water, a giant buddha that greets you as you walk in, and girls scattered throughout the club to make it seem more exotic.  But like many Vegas clubs here, it gets SO busy, that you have no option, but to continue to move up the different levels...And move up we did...up and then down, up and then down.  My poor legs and feet thought I was going through a Shaun T insanity workout...wahhh.....This up and down trek through the stairs was not by choice.  We were actually trying to get out and asked a few security guards the direction to get out.  Each time we were told something different and each time we ended up having to wait in a ridiculous line.  Were we being punked?? It took us a good 1+ hours to get out!  ..Based on my last experience at Tao, I vowed never to come back.  The decor is beautiful yes, but I didn\\'t like that my clubbing experience involved me going up and down stairs and being incorrectly directed towards a line that didn\\'t lead to exits for half the time..I love browsing Barnes and Noble. It is a little bit out of the way (much further north than I would prefer), but this location is amazing. The staff is super helpful without being overbearing. The cafe is nice and spacious and the cashiers are amazing! I\\'ll admit, yes...you can find books cheaper online these days....but there is nothing like browsing a bookstore and actually feeling the book in your hand. Love it!.4/5.Rocco\\'s has a Monday cheese pizza special that we enjoy: 1 large cheese = $10. The pizzas are generally hot enough, the price is right, and the crust is chewy and delicious. Pretty good pizza, though not Chicago style = my favorite.  The fist time I ordered a sausage pizza from Rocco\\'s, I thought it was ham.  I tried ordering sausage again and it was the same. Apparently, the thin sausage slices they use remind me more of ham, and are not very flavorful.  I hope Rocco\\'s changes their sausage because I really do enjoy the other components of their pizza. For now, I\\'ll stick with the cheese :-).Worse Pho place I\\'ve been to. .1. Soup base taste instant.2. Small portioning .3.water or tea was not served ..Don\\'t come here.Recently visited this studio for a massage. From the moment I walked in I was greeted with a smile and amazing customer service. My therapist was very knowledgeable and experienced and helped me out of some back pain. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great massage!.I\\'m really disappointed in this location because of hygiene. There are so few spray cleaners that you have to search for them to clean a machine,  and the towels are usually very dirty. The bathrooms are dirty, and the facility just smells bad in general. Today the ceiling is leaking and there\\'s just a recycling can to catch the water..I always look forward to going to the auto show there every year!  Ample parking and plenty of clean restrooms. There\\'s plenty of food and drinks too and you can burn it off with all the walking you\\'ll be doing! You\\'ll have a swell time here..I have not been to Outback in many many many years.  This experience reminded me of why.  The service was okay, ambiance is good.  The blooming onion was my favorite part of the meal.  As I remembered and expected.  The ribeye steak was not that great.  Likely the worst cut of meat I have had all year.  The mac & cheese side was just okay..I tried going here for happy hour but was early for it but I was hungry so I just checked the place out.  It was pretty empty for a Sunday afternoon.  Some people were there but it definitely wasn\\'t packed at all.  I sat at the bar and ordered a beer and a few appetizers and a bento box to go for my friend who was recovering from a hangover. LOL.  ..Prices here are steep but I enjoy quality food and well...you\\'re in Vegas on the strip in the Crystals mall..what do you expect?  I ordered the jalapeno hamachi sashimi and the cod lettuce wrap with foie gras.  Foie gras is extra but being from California where they outlawed it now I have to eat it any chance I get.  The cod with foie gras just melts in your mouth and the sashimi had the right amount of heat for my taste.  Definitely a nice bite to eat that wasn\\'t so filling but just made me feel ok before my tasting dinner at e by Jose Andres that night.  ..I\\'d come here again for their happy hour.  heard it\\'s pretty good..My fiancé and I ordered take out from here and for one they didn\\'t tell us the price over the phone.  But we were looking at their menu online and we were expecting to pay 27 dollars.  We went to pick it up and the bill totaled 37 dollars!!  For 2 people to eat at a Chinese restaurant this is crazy.  Not only were the prices online misleading but when we went to pick up the food the woman was extremely rude.  We will not be returning..Never known a lobby to be closed while it\\'s still bright outside. Drive thru avg wait is about 10-20 mins. I don\\'t think they make shit til you get to the window (ice cream excluded)..This place is super delicious and the price is just right!! All you can eat Korean BBQ AND sushi, can\\'t beat that. If you\\'re thinking about eating here JUST DO ITTT!.An indulgent deli, and I mean that in the best of ways.  Subway healthy this is not- and that is ok.  I come here if I want a good old fashioned splurge type of deli sandwich.  I ordered the 20 inch (!) Capastrami. Lots of salt on the pastrami,  full on mayo based  cole slaw, and no wheat rolls here.  Hits the spot.  ..Staff friendly, sandwich made in less than five minutes..THE WORST SERVICE!!!!!! I called in my to go order, they said 20m......I wait 25m and I go in and they still hadn\\'t put my order in!!!! And I had to be at work!!! And then they had the nerve to make me pay for a drink that I originally placed!!!! WTF dennys!!! Get your shhh together!!!! Horrible customer service!!!! At least give me my drink for free after you \\'forgot\\' to put in my order!!!!!.Well it is expensive, but it is a cool place...Best fries (In duckfat) ever. Great vibe...Oktoberfest made in Torontonian style..Have used this company 3 to 4 times hoping that the communication between office personnel and technicians would improve. Wrong..... i am not sure sure now how they stay in business. Techs do not follow intructions well at all. Do not uae this company, you will be very disappointed..to update - never received money for the items Terris sold.  They filed bankruptcy.. How convenient!?!!  Now I am in Scottsdale and happened to drive by their old store and guess what,  it is open again!?!!!  I would not trust this business!!!!.Loved it. Nice atmosphere. Food was excellent. Service was fantastic. Our waiter was patient and informative. Can\\'t wait to go back and try some other menu items..I\\'m usually willing to ignore the increasingly high prices at Demetre\\'s locations, because their desserts (especially their ice cream) are still high quality. Unfortunately, horrible service appears to be a pattern now, with this location definitely not an exception...At first, I assumed that the rude service we received was just another case of disinterested highschool kids, not being too invested in a temporary job...but when I read through other reviews, and the long history of terrible customer service, I\\'m starting to suspect these kids might be related to the owners?? How else have they not been fired by now? ..Our server Shabnam seated us at a sticky/dirty table, and looked annoyed when we asked her to actually wipe the table (gasp!). She and her co-worker ignored us several times as we tried to flag them down to order - the place was not busy either, they just preferred to chat. When seeking clarification about the confusing descriptions of one of the dishes, our server wouldn\\'t (couldn\\'t?) offer a simple explanation regarding the ingredients. ..The disappointing banana split we ended up trying did not come close to making up for the server\\'s poor attitude - it was small and filled mostly with whipped cream. I love the Roche ice cream here, but I think I\\'m done with Demetre\\'s until they clean up their act (and their tables!)..Excellent!! I love the hand-pull noodles and steam dumplings... people there were nice and considerate......highly recommend!.Definitely recommended. Fantastic and relaxing experience. I went twice, once with my sisters and once with my SO. Both times for the hot Rock Yin Yoga. Yin is a slow and controlled practice of gentle stretching. My companions could all handle it, even with varying degrees of flexibility. The best part being that you get to wear your own clothes, and are encouraged to take breaks outside of the heat and drink water. ..We visited on a weekend both times and it was busy. Everyone is quiet and relaxed however, so it is not bothersome. There are showers and generous sized change/waiting areas. Everything is very clean...The location is extremely inconvenient for me, which is the only drawback. If they opened a location closer to downtown or the east end I would purchase a pass for certain. Individual sessions are pricey, but they have a wide variety of packages and promotions. Follow them on twitter for specials..I came here for lunch when I stayed at the Wynn over the Christmas holiday. It was quite chaotic when we first walked in. No one was there greet us or point us to where we should order and other patrons who walked in before and after us also seemed a little confused...I had the 1/2 lb turkey burger. The burger was huge! It took me quite a while to finish it. For the price, I would have thought it would have came with fries, but I had to order that separately. Still definitely cheaper than eating at the buffet. The next time I am here, I will definitely try the pastrami sandwich..I have been to a few Psychics over the last ten years.  However, due to some recent changes within my family, career...life I have been seeking answers and some guidance.  ..As many have experienced, finding someone who is legit is not easy.  You never really know until you are there, in person, not only wasting your time but money as well. ..While visiting Arizona I figured I would try to meet with Lilly, who I came across during my search.  I sent Lilly an email, not expecting a response (simply due to my form of contact).  Well, she didn\\'t email me back...she called.   The fact that she called was not only impressive, but also made my decision of meeting with her non optional as I knew by our short conversation that she is not only genuine but she cares for her clients. ..We were both available to meet the following day.  In the past I\\'ve been to houses and little hole in the wall office\\'s usually attached to a stipmall.  However, when I pulled up to the address Lilly provided I was pleasantly surprised, it was a very professional office building. ..Lilly came out to the lobby to meet me.  She was very warm and friendly. Her office was absolutely amazing.  The moment I walked in I felt very comfortable and excited.   I couldn\\'t wait for Lilly to start my reading.   Not that I had any doubt from the first moment I talked to Lilly on the phone, but as soon as she began my reading  I knew I found not only the most legit psychic but also the most honest, open, and caring one as well. ..My reading literally left me speechless.  I am now excited for my future and what will become of it...I will tell everyone reading this, any negative reviews you may read regarding Lilly is completely inaccurate from my experience.  ..I can\\'t express enough how wonderful, amazing, warm, professional and sincere Lilly is.  I wouldn\\'t hesitate referring her to anyone and everyone!.Adam and the service team plus Chris are amazing!! Completely different from la location I go to. They are honest, have a great sense of humor and really stride to make the customer feel special!! Amazing boys.I thought they did great with my aunts viewing. They were very respectful of the immediate families wishes..Angee is such an amazing hair stylist!!  She does it all, hair extensions, cut dye, style, you name it. I\\'ve been going to her for YEARS. I recommend her to anyone who asks, and some that don\\'t!!.. When she puts extensions in, THEY STAY!!  Her braids are tight!!  She also does my daughter\\'s, granddaughters and other relatives hair. She\\'s simply amazing. A big PLUS, she\\'s always current with any new style!!.There used to be a day when you could drive along Albemarle Road (24/27) and you would encounter just about nothing the whole way to Albemarle.  Now,  you get Wal-Mart.  A supercenter, to be precise.  Now it is a nice one, all shiny and new, but still - have we turned the entire world into a giant, sprawling suburb?..Once you get past that disturbing fact, it is what it is...Wal-Mart is something of a fact of life, I suppose, and it is not particularly bad, unless you are one of their vendors who constantly gets beaten down on price in the name of the consumer...At least since most of the employees likely come from the immediate area, and are about as close as you could get to \"country folk\" these days, the staff is are generally friendly.  But still.  So much for the Sunday drive.  Might as well stay home and watch the Panthers lose..YUMMY! all the way around. I tell all my friends, best apple pie  and pies in  Henderson, Nevada  who would of thought. Head to Water Street Henderson now if you love cookies and pastries too.The best ever. Mmmm mmmm fresh ..because there is not a lot of business, most of the food there is cold. the flavours and taste is good and price is good, a lot of pork choices. skip the cakes they are not homemade and kind of stale..Took 17 friends and wedis the head to head rooms and competed.   None of us had done this.  Ages was 26-60++.   We did women against men making it really fun when we (the women won).  ..I would Highly recommend you do this!!! Only hint I\\'ll give is everything in all rooms is relevant and can be relevant throughout the escape.  ..We did many activities during this visit to Vegas and everyone agreed this was at the top..I\\'ve been here three times. Never once have I been greeted when entering the door.  When inquiring about a product or anything I\\'m met with annoyance and poor customer service. Prices are on the high end and not fair also with little warranty. Condition of the games look poor and unkept...Not sure about their console repair. I\\'ve gone to this place with hope and every time walked away with nothing..So happy i discovered this little piece of heaven...it\\'s so festive and cute, just what i needed on a cold January canadian night. I had one of each taco, it was all very tasty. since i\\'m a seafood fiend, i loved the fish taco the most! ..they piled up the toppings all the way in the form of a little mountain on top of the tortilla.... mmmm! ..pick it up, chomp it down, lick the fingers, and wash it down with some hibiscus drink. all of that while you are surrounded by colorful lights and lucha libre masks - it\\'s a bit of mexicana magic right here. ..there\\'s only like six seats - teeny shop..I booked Escoba for a bridal shower solely based on pictures so I wasn\\'t quite sure what to expect however the manager: Laurel O\\'Leary and her staff made the bridal shower an event to remember. During the booking process, Laurel O\\'Leary was very accommodating. She was very quick to respond to my inquiries and she was also kept me informed about all costs associated with planning the event at her establishment so there were no surprises on the day of the event. I was very impressed by this classy restaurant. The ambience was very warm and cozy. The staff was warm and welcoming. During the decoration process, the staff made the bridal team feel comfortable and offered their assistance anyway they could. The assisted us with putting up balloons, setting up a disco ball, putting pictures of the bride up on screen and so many other things. They were very patient with us and accomodated all our impromptu requests like accommodating additional guests that we weren\\'t expecting. The food was absolutely amazing. The private space we occupied remained private. The waiters were very patient during the ordering and payment process. Overall, I must say that I was very impressed with Laurel & her team. I will definitely be back to this venue for the next party I plan.  Thanks again Laurel! You definitely contributed to making the bride\\'s day special. I hope to see you soon..I absolutely love this place. ..I have been to both this location and the one on King street and they are the same (food, decor, cleanliness, service) therefore my review will be for both locations. ..I have had the avocado lime salad with quinoa the first and second time I visited B.Good and added tofu to it. If you like a little extra spiciness, request the jalapeño sauce. ..I have also tried the veggie burger on a paleo/keto friendly bun which was amazing. The veggie burger isn\\'t dry (which is sometimes a big problem) and the bun is out of this world. So cool to be able to enjoy a burger without all the carbs! ..The service is always friendly and fast enough given the type of food they serve. Do not expect McDonald\\'s type of speed when eating actual food..If I were playing the word association game, after going here, my first word would be: MEH...This place is so overrated and like the other reviews say, just completely disorganized when it comes to going in. So my friends and I got all dolled up thinking that we would get some promoter\\'s attention which basically worked everywhere but here. We were like, alright, cute asian girls.. alas NO. One of my friends actually spotted someone who looked like a promoter (and turned out to be one) who put us on the list probably cuz we asked. ..After getting there, we realized why we probably were not approached - this is completely not our scene. Unfortunately we\\'re not so into euro-techno music and people were not at dressed up as we thought they would be. ..When we got there this big promoter guy told us to just hang out near one of the velvet ropes because we were on the list. He wasn\\'t really clear and put us in a line with a group of guys. After a while he saw that we were standing in the wrong place and then finally let us in. ..We got in the club and man.. it was kind of boring from the get go. We decided we would get our drinks, down it and hop over to Tao. Too bad we weren\\'t more drunk at that time because maybe we would have stayed, but our intense sobriety warned as against that. As we tried to leave, some guy told us to go another way. Well, liar, it wasn\\'t another way... it was another room where a crowd of people were just standing there watching half naked girls dance. I\\'m not sure what impression we gave that guy, but I could have sworn we had the desperate-to-get-out-here look, not the we-want-to-look-at-other-girls-dance look. ..At least in the end we made it out and over to Tao where we definitely had a much more exciting night (aka VIP, patron, belvedere, fun).Good sushi and really good happy hour prices with 6 dollar Sake bombs! We especially liked how friendly the staff was. We will definitely be back..Excellent place. Best coffee in Chandler by far. Pourovers are delicious; Nitro cold brew so refreshing. Even their Cascara tea and lemongrass lemonade are amazing for those non-coffee drinkers (gasp)...The baristas and owners are super friendly, and I love the ambiance of the place. When they\\'re roasting a batch, which they do right in store in the open, the whole place smells divine. ..I definitely recommend this place to any coffee lover..Beer: excellent.  Started out with 2 pints of bilbo  baggins.  Awesome. The bartender was great and explained the brewing process and the seasonal selections. ..The restaurant was empty when we got there. I think there was a home game at the U. Seemed big enough, though. Lots of seating. Definitely a pub atmosphere. ..We did look at a menu, and at first glance, it looked substantial until we saw another couple order a pizza. We then saw the bartender take a frozen store bought pizza out of some plastic and stick it in an easy bake oven. No shade, if it works, it works. ..Will be back here for the beer, most definitely!.Who doesn\\'t love a bargain? I get an adrenaline rush every time I find a great piece at the fraction of the retail price. I don\\'t even mind if it is used as long as it still looks new-ish. I thought A Second Look would be a great place to get that shopper\\'s rush, but boy was I wrong. ..The place reminds me of my grandmother\\'s closet because it has the hallmark finicky old woman organization. Everything is arranged according to color with signs everywhere proclaiming the consequences of touching and breaking. It is a little overwhelming. ..The clothes are not that great. Everything in the designer section looks like it came off the Beverly Hills 90210 set circa 1990, and it is marked up like crazy. The rest of the store follows suit; for example, I saw a faded shrunken American Apparel dress for $13.00 (I can\\'t even begin to tell you what is wrong with that picture). ..While I commend the staff for meticulously keeping the store in perfect condition, I did not see anything that I would think of giving a second look..Better than most and creative..no real ambiance and the language barrier is there. ..They *do* have the BEST shred tempura I have ever had. ..Soup tastes powdery. Meh. But love the purple rice. Tons of choices of fun sushi to try if you are adventurous. People are nice. ..Slow for take out. Be warned..Staff was extremely rude and do not look well groomed. I asked her if I could change my order before I even gave her any money and she rudely said \"no\" definitely won\\'t be back.My family calls me the cookie monster whenever we get a bag of these cookies, so now we get 2 bags. One for me and another so I can share with them...Everything they put together is addictive. The protein balls were great after a 2 hour session of yoga (none of that powder taste you get from protein bars). I tried the banana bread (it made my heart happy with a cup of milk). The granola has been a great snack between meals for me since I am trying to stay away from the vending machines at work..Amazing Spa!! The therapists are friendly & knowledgable. Went for a facial with Julia and LOVED every second of my experience. Highly recommend booking with her!.We dined here while waiting for our show at the Excalibur. Nice steak and cooked to perfection. We had a lobster bisque to start and mains of a lobster tail and fried stuffed king prawn with asparagus to share. Nice atmosphere and good service too..The BEST veggie quesadilla I\\'ve had in a long time!  Great food, Great Service!.Small and dirty, this McDonalds is clowning around...The food is what you expect but the atmosphere is nothing special. Split in two with the front open and airy but the back is tight and stuffy...I\\'d rather go hungry than dine in here again..Well, I am so damn easy to please. All I ask is for a well poured drink in a cushy leather bar seat and some good music. AND BAM! There I am at the GM enjoying just that and a whole lot more. ..This neighborhood joint opened up a few months ago and I finally got to visit twice. Both times, I sat at the inside bar, which features large comfy leather chairs you might find in someone\\'s home. The bartenders are very accommodating and fast with your pour. Just what you want in someone handling your liquor ;)..Each time, I had the nachos, which has the most mouth watering short ribs and shrimp, covered in a special sauce drizzled all over the nachos, with cheese and I don\\'t even know what else but it\\'s AWESOME!!! My aunt and uncle have been here on my recommend, and she had the ahi tuna. I don\\'t know what my uncle had but they both loved their meals, all of it. They found the place packed on a Friday night around 7. I\\'m smart and get there at 3 or 4, so I can drink in relative peace, eat my entire nachos plate without a bunch of good looking guys around making me self conscious, and get home before the amateur drinkers start leaving. ..The vibe is cool, down to earth like one of the owner\\'s I met, the \"monkey\" of the 2 male owners. I don\\'t know why he is \"monkey\", but he\\'s very nice. Chats up the bar, and makes sure everyone is at the minimum level of enjoyment. Hey, you gotta bring your own party, there\\'s only so much the owner\\'s can do...So score big for Chandler! It\\'s worth the drive. Not every fabulous place is located in downtown anymore. There\\'s an outdoor bar and patio too. Me likey :)..See you at the bar. I\\'m the chick at the end, digging in my nachos like it\\'s my only meal of the day. Which, it pretty much is. ..ps. LOVE the bathrooms!!! Each stall is completely enclosed like it\\'s own little throne. So pretty too!.Loved the ambience. Good selection of beer. They have some spirits available as well! Also some table snacks. I think the pricing is fair :) My favorite part was the ambience and how the overall interior is. There\\'s a wide open area at the entrance (for summer, I believe) where there are two tables outside. The rest of the seating is inside the bar. Very neat idea for Champaign, reminds me of LA! :).Do not order the salt and pepper shrimp it\\'s not full head shrimp they use little shrimps. The service is good the beer prices are cheap. Soup was great rice and veggies were fresh wasn\\'t a big fan of the meat dishes felt they could of used higher grade meat and fresh meat. Ok for basic Chinese restaurant. Prices a little high for the quality of food..Love the food!! Love that they have gluten free options! Only feedback I\\'d give is I\\'ve seen several times the host not be very organized on busy days to accommodate and seat people efficiently..Had brunch here this morning with my friend J and we enjoyed it.  But it wasn\\'t anything amazing that makes me say we have to go back soon... It was very busy (11 a.m. on a Sunday so not surprising) and very noisy, we probably waited 20-25 minutes for a table.  It\\'s pretty small inside too so there\\'s lots of pushing past people and saying excuse me and all that.   In terms of breakfast/brunch places in Vegas, the Cracked Egg is better than Black Bear Diner but not as good as Hash House a Go Go.  Better than IHOP and much better than Pancake House.  Not as good as DW Bistro.  But both DW and Hash House are also more expensive...We both had the Cakes & Eggs (with bacon) and it was good.  Nothing amazing but I enjoyed it and would go back again.  Reasonable price for about $12.  Service was adequate but again, nothing special.  She got us what we needed and that was about it.  ..One thing I didn\\'t like - if you pay with a card and want to put the tip on the card, you have to tell the cashier how much you want to tip.  Makes me uncomfortable and I find it tacky.  Next time I\\'ll bring some cash!.Paid a decent amount to play golf. Don\\'t get me wrong, course was in great condition but pace of play wasn\\'t worth what I spent. Shot my worst round ever because each hold we were stuck behind the group in front of us for 15-20 minutes. Called the clubhouse and ranger said Not much he could do. This also wasn\\'t a Saturday or Sunday, but a Monday. I\\'ll think twice before booking here again. Not happy about it at all. I paid for 4 people..First time visiting and I got a chance to enjoy some sweets that I was familiar with from before.  No idea what they are called but there\\'s some that resemble a wheel and the others look like cream puffs.  Got a chance to also try one that looked like an ice cream cone.  Aside from Persian pastries, this store features some groceries at convenience as well as a variety of bulk items.  ..Open late, and the prices are pretty decent as well..My husband and I ate at Tina\\'s last night and had a wonderful time! Tina was extremely friendly and  accomodating and genuinely wanted to be sure that we had a spectacular evening!  We felt like we were friends by the time we left and were laughing and joking with her as if we had known her for years. Tina ads a personal touch to this boutique cafe with a cultural experience that will leave you with fond memories!  Thanks so much again! We had a great time!.I have been shopping here for several years. The staff is great, the service is good, the store is clean and their selection is pretty wide. This is one of the better Food Lion locations in Charlotte. No complaints here. It\\'s my go to neighborhood store.The chicken has fallen off! No flavor but was nicely presented. The gizzards were ok fried a little soft. The tea and potato salad was everything. The wait time wasn\\'t bad at all. The pricing is cool but I\\'d be okay to visit the city and not eat here again..I was new to Toronto when I visited Local 4 a few months ago.  They were on my radar of places to check out due to a reputation for craft beers and good food that I\\'d heard through a friend -- and, when they popped up as a Groupon, I jumped.  The menu and beerlist on their website really sealed the deal...I invited a couple other friends who had never been to come along, one of whom is a picky eater (and, after looking at the site, was excited), the other of whom, like me, is always looking to try new beers...So we get to Local 4...  and it\\'s a huge let down...The food was mediocre to bad.  ..I had the bison spaghetti bolognese, which tasted as though they forgot to salt the water when cooking the noodles.  The sauce was ok, but there was precious little of it.  When I order a pasta dish at a restaurant and it\\'s $14, I expect it to be something more than I can prep, at home, with little effort.  I wouldn\\'t have been ashamed to serve it myself, but I certainly wouldn\\'t have expected any particular compliments after the fact...Steak & Frites went to one friend, who\\'s experience was similar to others here:  steak was dry, tough, bad...Other friend had the chicken cordon bleu -- she finished the chicken, which was decent (but again, nothing special), then left the potatoes and vegetables as unpalatable.  I was incredulous, so tried a few...  and she was right...But the kicker was the beer list or, more appropriately, the lack of one.  They didn\\'t have a single one of the craft beers we specifically came to try -- we ended up ordering some Blanche de Chambley (a personal fave, but not one I was hoping to \"try\"), then stuck with cocktails.  They didn\\'t have MacAuslan (either apricot or stout), Black Oak, or Stonehammer (dark or light).  Are you kidding me?  You\\'re touting your craft beers, and your selections are mostly imports, Sleemans, and a cider?  And what you do have are the most common, usual suspects: Mill St, Steamwhistle, and the like?  ..We were bummed.  Add to this that the server had a rather uncaring attitude, was slow, and, when presenting the bill, just dumped it on the table.  Even forgot to factor in the Groupon, and seemed annoyed that I wanted him to adjust it.  (Now I feel like I\\'m ragging on the guy -- he seemed like a cool guy, just kind of out of his depth.)..In any case, I would hesitate giving a 1* rating to Local 4 if only because there\\'s great potential there:  nice ambience, cool location, a menu that looks good on paper...  but they need to seriously re-evaluate what they\\'re doing and their approach to food, drink, and service...Judging by recent reviews, they\\'re certainly not watching review sites for what people are saying, and that\\'s too bad..Absolutely best massage I\\'ve ever had! My team went today to get the $22/hr massages... We were all mind blown, so much so that we plan to go once a month. We were expecting 10 minutes on back and 50 on feet. Uh... No... It was a full body experience, and it felt soooo good. I felt all my knots release, and the lotion smelled like plumeria. Big thank you to Coco for doing a wonderful job!.I was here for a business trip not long ago, and I was particularly impressed with the staff.  The front desk night manager, Bash, was absolutely on top of it. There was a mistake made with my room - we are all human and mistakes happen. I went down to speak with him about it, and he was VERY proactive, accommodating and thoughtful about the matter.  ..At breakfast the first morning, I was in a hurry and not all that hungry. I just grabbed a boiled egg and a piece of fruit.  The server, clearly also very conscientious about her work, charged me the \"employee breakfast\" rate.  Normally,  wouldn\\'t advocate for people making those kinds of decisions on the fly, but clearly, the company still made more than adequate money for what I ate.  ..This place is convenient, and has a great staff.  It exemplifies the Hilton brand..My wife and I ate lunch there yesterday on the patio.  The inside is very nice and a very large bar area.  Service was good.  I ordered the beef short ribs which was very good.  The part that really put me off was the mashed potatoes.  There is only ONE option and that is Horseradish mashed potatoes.  I was hesitant because I just don\\'t do horseradish in anything.  It was not horrible but come on, Horseradish mashed potatoes?  Garlic or plain, Yes.  I\\'m surprised there is not at least one other option for mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately, that is enough to keep me from coming back because I love mashed potatoes but not Horseradish!!!.Great bar ...like the rock music. Rap and hip hop is so played out. Nice to have something different..Walk ins are welcome. That means you can walk in and request the next available stylist. What they don\\'t tell you is how long or approximately how long the wait might be. I was only one of two people waiting and I ended up waiting for 45 minutes. I kept getting told it wouldn\\'t be much longer. 3 people all got done with cuts at the same time so I thought I\\'d be next. Three of the stylists then all proceeded to go smoke and or order food for lunch.  Approx 10 minutes later I was able to finally get my haircut. It felt rushed and definitely was not what I\\'d consider a good hair cut. Overall a very poor customer experience from my end for a first time customer. I won\\'t be back nor would I recommend this place to others..First and last time at the tpc stadium course. Course was in poor condition. Greens were beat to heck. They still had the big cups and flags on the greens. The starter was a no show at the first tee but then caught up to me on 1 green and asked me why I wasn\\'t with the group in front of me as I was a single. I just told him that there was no one on the tee and the starter was no where to be found, so what else was I suppose to do. Joined up with the threesome in front of me and enjoyed the company. That was until 18 when we were heckled by a bunch of drunk douche bags on the patio bar at the clubhouse. They began to throw golf balls out on the green while we were still putting out.  Mentioned the incident to a club employee and he just said sorry.  ..There are so many other places to play in Scottsdale so make sure this one doesn\\'t make your list. My local public course in Houston is much better than this goat track..Went here for some dinner after getting off a flight. Had the Szechuan chicken wrap as an appetizer, which was absolutely delicious. Then had the peach Bellini, which was also a delicious and refreshing new slushy drink. The hunters chicken, steak, and jambalaya bowl were also great, and the service during the whole meal was impeccable and some of the best i have ever experienced . Would definitely go here again..Ehhh. I don\\'t usually post bad reviews,  but in this case I\\'m pissed. No strawberry lemonade or mint limeade. The horchata & southwest limeade machine isn\\'t even turned on, so everything is room temp. The bathroom was embarrassing. I haven\\'t even eaten my food yet, I\\'m actually nervous. Had they at least been friendly I could give a 2nd star, but no such luck..My cousin recommended me to this location, I\\'m not a local so I wasn\\'t sure what to expect. The place was pretty big. There is a dinning area that is separated from the hookah lounge which was cool. They also serve food in the lounge and drinks. I really like the decor they have in the lounge it was Egyptian themed. We ordered the skittles flavor which is pretty light from what I usually smoke but it was nice. They have a dance floor and a dj tonight when I went. It was a mixture of pop and Cumbia. It\\'s a very chill homey environment. The employees came by to check on us every so often and refilled our glass of water. It was pleasant. I do wish it was a bit more hyped for a Friday night, but it was relaxing. We didn\\'t get to try the food so I have no opinion in that area. Update* so I came back day 2 of my trip to Vegas and they don\\'t allow coal changes and you only get one coal. That\\'s quite unheard of. I was like 0.o not sure how I even feel about that. In order to get a new coal we would have to order a refill. . . ..I\\'ve had better!  The service was mediocre and the bulgogi was not good. Quite an expensive meal so we should\\'ve been satisfied..Sometimes you want to go to a unassuming neighborhood bar that is sort\\'ve like Cheers. Obvious there are regulars here, but you won\\'t feel unwelcomed being a stranger. ..There\\'s graveyard food specials starting at 11pm for $5.99.  We got wings and fries. If you like really crispy wings you probably will like this place. I really liked the fries though since despite being steak fries, it has a really crispy exterior. Original stromboli has mozzarella, ham and pepperoni and is actually pretty damn good. It\\'s pretty stuffed with fillings. I know a lot of people are about this other famous bar stromboli but I like this better since it\\'s not as doughy and has sauce on the side. Yes, I would order these items again. ..Bartenders here are friendly. A off the clock one chatted us up at the bar and Mario is a lovable asshat. He\\'s my favorite. ..If drinking and food aint enough, you can play pool, darts, A Golden Tee game and they have karaoke on Fridays. Our group played darts and listened to people kareoke-ing. Thankfully it was pretty good and not painfully bad singers this night. Hopefully they\\'re regulars. ..If you want a fun, low-key night out that isn\\'t going to cost you a crazy amount, I say this is a good place to consider..I love the home make corn beef!!! It is the best in town. I have visit there a couple of time just for the corn beef.The park has gone down hill. There used to be a lot more animals and a lot more fun but now things are super strict and not what it\\'s made out to be. The drive through safari was the best part but still wasn\\'t as fun as it used to be..I absolutely love this place!  Years ago I stopped by another salon close by and no one spoke to me.  I left, stopped in here and have never been anywhere else since!  All the girls are so professional and friendly and my pedis last forever!  Awesome!.A must go... really good food for cheap price.. the place is clean as well... I definitely recommend it.My first experience at this post office was horrible. Of course, it was just before Christmas, and I\\'m sure the employees were tired as all get out... ..I was trying to pick up a package for my mom and had no idea where to go. It took me 3 employees just to find out I needed to wait in the same line as everyone else. ..I get it, it\\'s a small location. ..Now, on the other hand, during a less busy time, I\\'ve had a great experience. The employees that normally man the counter are much nicer than the staff that works in the back (who happened to misdirect me several times during my first visit.) Hopefully, with more visits, I can bump this rating up. ..On a side note: It\\'s a cute little building and it really gives you that small-town feel despite this being just about the only thing left in Higley. I know, it\\'s kind of superficial, but it\\'s somehow a plus. :).Overall: Eggslut is good, but it\\'s not wait-in-a-looooooong-line-to-pay-too-much-for-eggs good. I\\'ll just stay at home and whip up my own, thank you very much...Food: 3..We got the Bacon, Egg, & Cheese and Sausage, Egg, & Cheese. They tasted as expected. I do appreciate that their egg was well cooked and that their buns weren\\'t soggy. However, I think the price is astronomical for something that can easily be made at home. Trust me, I\\'ve paid far more for far less without a peep because it\\'s creativity warranted it...Service: 3..As a casual eatery, you order at the counter and pick up your order to eat when your name is called. The line was long, but it wasn\\'t more than a 20-25 minute wait when I stopped by on a Saturday morning. The staff keeps everything moving pretty fast...Ambiance: 3..It\\'s a cute store in the Cosmo, but seating is very limited. I guess they assumed people might walk and eat or sit somewhere else in the Cosmo? But the sandwiches can get super messy when you eat them, so more seating would be nice..Huge shoutout to Michael Storms for making my birthday so special. I was supposed to go to postinos for my Birthday but I was super sick!  Michael brought me food even though it was out of their delivery zone complete with coupons and a birthday card!  Talk about going the extra mile!!!!.I have been trying to find a nice nail salon to go to and this is the one I love the most. They always go above and beyond to do my nails the way I like and they speak very good English and are able to help in any way. Everyone is so sweet, ask for Tracie, she does AMAZING!!.I think this place does a great job especially for the younger kids who like to jump as well. My sons always leaves sweaty and it is very reasonably priced. The only negative is that it tends to be a bit dirty due to people eating, more vacuuming!.Hmm...so why am I at Walmart in Sin City?!!..Came here on an errand run to buy snacks, drinks, and other necessities. This Walmart is gorgeous and spacious, and the staff is SUPER friendly and helpful. They were actually the best Walmart employees I encountered, and I been to many Walmart in different states and counties. One of the guys (wish I remembered his name for a shoutout) went out of his way to walk me to the other end of the store to show me where the \"finishing nails\" were. I guess you receive great customer service when your city is not over saturated. ..Although the BEST SUPERCENTER Walmart I went to was in Hangzhou, China!..I was able to get everything I needed quickly and efficiently, and the best part was there were a lot of cashiers ready and available to check me out...I am discouraged to go to the Walmart nearby my house because of the super crowded shopping aisles, no parking, and dreadful, long lines at the checkout. ..Major props to cleanliness and superb customer service!.Had nachos.  Were really good but portion was small. Beer was cold but not cold enough. Service was good. Atmosphere was good. It\\'s close to home so I will go back.  The best part was the chocolate molten lava cake for dessert.  It was extremely good. Must try dessert..Nice place to grab a bite for lunch.  It\\'s located in the Fashion Square Mall.  That\\'s the worst part about this place, the parking.  It\\'s not an easy in/out.  So don\\'t plan a working lunch here unless you want to deal with it...My favorite dish here is the Hickory Burger, $10.75.  It\\'s a pretty big Burger and it comes with Steak Fries.  It will fill you up nice...It\\'s never too busy at lunchtime and we enjoy sitting on the \"patio\" out in the mall....makes for great people watching...Staff is so/so....lot\\'s of college age kids who\\'s first job serving is here, so the service is inconsistent...Overall it\\'s A-OK...Return Factor - 65%.Lot\\'s of great selections - my only main issue is that it\\'s gets packed but hey, you can\\'t blame them if they\\'re doing great in business! :).The Carbon Bar isn\\'t typically the type of place our west-end centric party would be found at, but we were lured by the idea of trying something new and exciting to make the trek \"across town\". The truth is that no matter which direction you\\'re coming from, the Queen East-just address is about as central as you can get and was only minutes away from the Queen subway station...I\\'m not sure whether to blame it on the reservations (they are booked up far in advance, so who knew when we would be back?), their location (having lived outside of the core for a while now, the crowds and traffic can be a detractor), or most honestly - our gluttonous ways, we ordered way too much food. Don\\'t be fooled by this following list into thinking that the portion sizes are minuscule because they are not. With that said, between the four of us, we tried every cocktail and somehow managed to polish off all of these fabulous dishes (minus a couple ribs and half of a pie):..-2 x crisp chicken skins - Basically, these would be Crispers if pork crackling were regular chips. .-hamachi ceviche - delicate, appetizingly zingy.-raw salad featuring corn nuts and shaved coconut - Gorgeous and texturally tasty.-the Pit Master platter which included some of the juiciest BBQ turkey we have ever tasted and a heck of buttery slow cooked meats.-blackened sea bass with fried yuca sticks - So nicely cooked I cannot wait to come back and order one all to myself as a main..-porcini n\\' grits - amazing flavour all around.-hot mess sweet potato fries topped with brisket - A mini gourmet poutine .-2 x banana toffee cream pies - Tastebud meltingly delicious...Considering the fact that my drinks of choice were a substantial Caesar and a salt-rimmed margarita featuring St.Germain, I think I got the nutritional intake of several days\\' worth of nourishment in that one meal. ..Don\\'t miss the cluster of screens at the front bar area that shows curious and inspired short videos curated by CB\\'s GM, Adam Teolis. Whether it\\'s before or after your meal, grab up a seat at the bar and let the friendly bartenders make you something special to  sip while you take in the high ceilings, eclectic crowd, and fantastic acoustics..This location closed for a while and boy was I sad.  They reopened and its been great not having to leave strip to get these tacos. As always its super busy specially with the strip crowd but lines move fast. If its night time keep an eye out for drunk people who might  wonder into other lines and upset people. I have seen two fights over this a few months back.  Tacos are small since they are authentic style and the adobada tacos have the avocado sauce which is typical of TJ style tacos..Best bang for your buck! Simple menu but everything on there is delicious - this place definitely deserves the 5 stars it has earned. Burgers are a really nice size, juicy and flavorful! Our table had the beef, elk, bison and boar burgers. None of them disappointed! Try the corn chowder too. Honestly one of the best corn chowders I\\'ve ever had. The chef was on Chef\\'s Table so he is a professional chef and super friendly. Not only is the food 5 star but the service is 5 star too. Spoke with the chef and this place used to be a fine dining restaurant which he converted to a burger place. Everything is freshly made! Love this find - a gem!.I have a home warranty and called for a repair to dishwasher, the dry cycle wasn\\'t working. The first time they came my dad was here to let them in. They told him nothing was wrong and left with my $75.00. Called them to come back and made sure I was here, tech used a gauge and told me \"I was not crazy\" it was not registering heat. Ordered a part, came back installed new part and said if that doesn\\'t fix it call us, it could be something else. Ran dishwasher still no dry dishes, called back. They told warranty company they closed my case, nothing wrong I just need to use Jet Dri. Warranty company sent different company this morning. Technician pulled dishwasher out (ADA did not) reset a part in the back, Just ran the dishwasher my dishes are dry! From now on home warranty call I will insist they use Home Appliance Service, would have saved so much headache had they come first..Not very good, nor very authentic at all. I wouldn\\'t go back again and I got a bellyache after it. What does a Taiwanese girl have to do to find good Taiwanese food in the city?!??.My family and I were in town for SuperBowl weekend and stayed at the Flamingo as they do every year. i, myself havent been to las vegas for a couple years, but again, it was a great trip and a great experience. great staff and nice upgrades were made. we stayed in the spa tower. nice room, with a nice view of the High Roller. Ive added a few pics of the room and the view...we really liked having a tv in the mirror in the bathroom. lol. cool option. although ours didnt work. the one in my parents room did though...we really liked the options of food at 2, 3 or 4am when we get off the gaming tables, have something to eat and stumble up to our rooms lol. since we are from hawaii, we dont have johnny rockets. we liked the food there. also the hot dog place, and the asian food places have also satisfied our cravings in the middle of the night haha...great location, with the linq and harrahs on one side, and the cromwell on the other. also the Caesars palace across the street, and the bellagio down the road, we could actually see part of the bellagio water fountain show while we were waiting for the elevator on our floor. hotel is easily accessible although there is construction in neighboring areas. and the valet staff is very helpful when we needed directions or recommendations on other asian restaurants in the area and how to get there...i really liked the renovation and re organization of the casino in the table game area. i also like the new slot machines and the penny slots they added. (to me, its new since i havent been there in a couple of years)..a big thanks again to the staff. everyone from the front desk, room service, dealers and pit bosses, and everyone else. everyone was so nice and helpful if and when we needed anything...i would definitely recommend this hotel to any friends or family who are looking around for a hotel to stay at while visiting las vegas. i cant wait to return and i will stay there again..I had moved to the North York area and went to this location for the first time..It was a very windy day, and when I got out of the store after shopping, there was a 6 foot scratch along the right side of my car.  I figured I got it due to the wind pushing a shopping cart, so I went back into the store to speak to the manager..The manager wasn\\'t in at the time and one employee gave me an attitude that it cannot happen and they can\\'t do anything about it.  .At that time, I was so mad but tried to keep calm and left my number for the manager to call me back.  .I spoke to the manager and she was nice and asked me come in so she can fill out the damage report and get the car fixed at one of their partnered shops..Unlike the employee from the day before, the manager was nice and willing to help...Although the whole thing could have been prevented by ignorant shoppers leaving their carts everywhere on a windy day, or employees making sure carts are not rolling around in the parking lot, the manager\\'s followup service made the whole incident bearable.  I am still a bit hesitent to go back here, but I will be careful where I park next time I go...Product and price-wise, it\\'s typical Metro, but I mostly go there for Air Miles promotions..Mediocre food with shitty drink selection. Service was poor as we had to flag the waiter several times before ordering..I love having a Starbucks right in town. When I\\'m driving my kids home from school or practice we love to stop in and get refreshers or frozen drinks. The whole place is so warm and inviting, and the workers are always so kind..Good southern food for cheap! Kind of a long wait for the food, but it is made fresh to order so it\\'s understandable..I came here awhile back with a group and tried the cold chicken, since it seemed very similar to Singaporean chicken rice (I spent several months in Singapore).  Although that dish is typically served warm, the flavor and texture of the chicken was very similar to it, and it was an enjoyable reminder of that cuisine.  I don\\'t remember details of the service except that it was a bit confusing at one point since they were out of something and had trouble communicating that.  I\\'d come back here to try the cold chicken or another Cantonese dish again! 3.5 stars..Super quick and I like how I can out whatever I want on a pizza and watch them make it right in front of me. Staff is always pleasant and I like their lemonade. Lol.If you grow up in Brampton McKay pizza is part of your life.   This small pizzeria is situated in the corner of a old plaza of Brampton they have extended hours all year round.  Offer delivery service which always comes as fast as a pick up order..My favorite is the McKay special which is loaded with fresh ingredients pepperoni mushrooms bacon green  peppers  tomato onions and generous tasty cheese. The pizza is always cooked to perfection with a nice crust and light tasty sauce. I also have had their Sicilian pizza which is a twice cooked deep dish style pie but not flooded with sauce or grease like other deep dish pizzas.  A small is more like a medium and the taste is mouthwatering soo good. .My daughter loves their stuffed patties which most Brampton kids learn to love.  They use a Jamaican style beef patty open it up and stuff with lettuce cheese and mayo a BIG hit among teenagers...You can not and would not have pizza from anywhere else once you have had this awesome pizza!.This review is for the nail services only!!!..I went here on a deal voucher and thought, hey why not?!?  The front staff was kinda bitchy but the nail tech was super nice.  ..She did a good job and took her time. So far so good on the nails, I\\'m really hard on them too and they are holding up.  Would I pay full price, ehhh...dunno, cause it wasn\\'t anything special..O&I is the bees knees - face down (ass up) one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale/Phoenix, for sure!..My significant lover and I stumbled upon this place by accident, we were actually trying to find Culinary Dropout but my (retarded) GPS led us astray but lo and behold - Olive & Ivy stared at us...and we stared right back into its glorious face...It\\'s a huge restaurant and has a very upscale/classy vibe, but still maintains a romantically casual mood.  There\\'s plenty of outdoor seating but what really takes the cake is the private dining in the back, which you typically need to reserve in advance unless you\\'re lucky...Service is always friendly and spot on but, of course, what really shines is the food.  Allow me to plan out your entire meal for you (you\\'re welcome):..1. Start with the trifecta order of bruschetta and pick: prosciutto & fig, manchego, and fresh mozzarella.  You have not truly enjoyed bruschetta until you eat the aforementioned ones...2. Prosciutto & mascarpone tortelli for sure...3. Chicken scallopini - so tender, so juicy, so flavorful, AND it has prosciutto and mozzarella.  What more could you ask for?..4. If you\\'re feeling baller I say it\\'s justified to spend $38 on the Filet of beef.  You will not regret your choice...unless you accidentally forget and order the bone-in ribeye instead (I warned you)...5. I\\'m not big on getting dessert here since Gelato Spot is just down the street, but if you\\'re up for it - try the peanut butter pudding...Bonus Tip: Go to Costco (or visit the website) and pick up the Fox Restaurant Concepts gifit cards.  You can buy two $50 giftcards for only $79.99, so that\\'s 20% savings right there...And there you have it.  Get your gift cards from Costco, make your reservation on opentable, book the private dining area, experience heavenly flavors, and get ready to fall in love with Olive & Ivy..I\\'m going to tell you two things straight up: 1) I am vegan and 2) I haven\\'t eaten a hot dog (even a soy dog) since I was 7 years old. And I don\\'t plan to any time soon.  So why would I go to a hot dog place?..Wellllllllllllllll - as of late, the Lunch Box has been offering Korean tacos as a special, and they have a vegan tofu taco!! Whaaaa? Do I live in LA? Who would have thought that Las Vegas would ever get in on the vegan KT action?.And it is ridiculously good.  I think about it a lot.  Perfectly grilled cubes of tofu in a luscious marinade served up in a soft warm corn tortilla and topped with kimchee, sesame seeds and green onions.  At 2/$4 (served with a side of edamame), how can you beat this?! I\\'m a bit of a piggy pig, and I was comfortably full.  I considered going back for more, even though I was pretty full, just b/c they were THAT GOOD.  They also had a bulgogi (meat) taco...Vegans and vegetarians - the soy dogs are vegan, but the buns have egg, and they helpfully acknowledge that on their menu board.  ..I heard good things about the turkey chili dog from my omnivorous companion.  ..Follow them on Twitter or FB to find out when they have the specials like the tacos!! Worth a visit even if you\\'re not a dog fan!.If no star was an option, I would defiantly put that instead. The ordering was very unorganized. The staff was pretty friendly and tried to help out as much as they could but still only seemed to be trainees. One female staff with black hair and chubby cheeks was extremely rude and neglected every request that was made. Even after the total negative vibe from chubby, she had the nerve to ask us to tip her even though it\\'s an option. An older woman who seemed to be the manager was very friendly but all in all, I\\'ll never come back..Can\\'t speak of the Pho because I didn\\'t order it. ..But the bun vermicelli with bbq grilled chicken and spring roll, was divine. ..I really questioned my friends choice of going here. C\\'mon Vietnamese on Ossington?  Ok guys, I won\\'t be difficult and go along. ..But as I approached after parking the car I saw people racing in here like you wouldn\\'t believe. As you step inside. All you see are tables and people eating. There\\'s no space anywhere!  It\\'s a very popular neighbourhood spot. ..Service though is all business and a bit cold. After we were done eating, they cleared the table and dropped the bill on table even before we asked. (the signal to get the heck out sort of deal) we need your spot for another paying customer.   ..But you know what, the food was splendid. ..My dish was fresh and prepared well, the bean sprouts, herbs, vermicelli, bbq chicken was marinated and grilled well sprinkled with chopped peanuts, the spring rolls tasted perfect. I can\\'t fault it. It was probably the best bun vermicelli I remember having for a long time! ..Also noticed they offer some different choices, like herbed beef vermicelli, thinly sliced beef rolled in some herb leaf (looks like a cigar) and some pineapple  dishes. ..So strangely I\\'d be back to hit up this spot if I\\'m in Ossington again...note: they only accept cash.Matthew Donovan at Snell & Wilmer is my mother-in-law\\'s attorney and was my father-in-law\\'s attorney while he was alive.  He is a very difficult person to get a hold of and does not return phone calls or emails to answer questions about their estate.  He is rude and condescending when he does respond to questions.  ..Mr Donovan refused to give us an appointment even when he knew my husband and I were flying to Phoenix from Washington DC specifically to straighten out estate issues.  It took two weeks of phone calls, emails and my mother-in-law\\'s intervention to finally get an appointment to meet at his office...Also, Mr Donovan told us our son\\'s 529 which his deceased grandfather opened will be transferred to the 529 that my husband opened for our son.  This was nearly a month ago and nothing has happened.  I have sent 5 emails and 6 voicemails so far asking what the problem is and get no response...Unless you want to make it 100x more difficult for your heirs and family members, I do not recommend using this attorney and law firm for estates and trusts..Went in for my birthday dinner...Service was poor...Steak All fat.Felt rushed..Very disappointed..Use to be one of my favorite places.First time visit during our trip to Vegas! The trash can nachos were AMAZING!!!! The Bloody Mary is insane! Order it!!! Definitely looking forward to going back!.Quite a nice place for lunch.  Tasty szechuan noodles.  Juices seemed a bit pricey, and service was a bit slow overall, but nice portions of fresh food..This place was so delicious, I actually had double-breakfast. Come for the crepes, stay for the delectable sandwiches. I had the tandoori chicken panini and it was incredible..Really disappointing dinner. Two stars (instead of one) because the waiter was really attentive and quick with beverage refills and because it is a great atmosphere and we enjoyed the terrace (which was why we chose to come here for dinner)...I had Chopped Chicken Salad where nothing was chopped - not the lettuce, not the chicken (breast piece), not the sliced avocado and sliced hard-boiled egg ( just matchstick carrot and a bit of chopped tomato on the side) and completely drowning in a watery blue cheese dressing that swamped everything. I ate about half until I was left with a soggy pile of lettuce (did I mention not chopped) and a literal puddle of watery dressing. The chicken (not chopped) was fine but didn\\'t taste of the advertised lime cilantro marinade (probably because coated with the \"dressing\") and the avocado (not chopped) was good. We also had the meatloaf which arrived with a thick coat of congealed looking gravy so heavy-handed with black pepper it overpower everything else (except maybe salt). Apparently more is more - and not in a good way - on the dinner menu. ..I had an excellent brunch shortly after they opened and a very good burger and frites for lunch a couple months ago. Surprised the dinner was SO sub-par. My advice - stick to the brunch and sandwich menus and always avoid the watery blue cheese dressing..I ordered the  bowl (#17, I think). All in all, the mix of rice, , and lots and lots of lettuce didn\\'t work...I did taste a friend\\'s spicy pork bowl, and that seemed okay, but I probably won\\'t be back..I like this airport just fine - usually I\\'m just in and out, so I don\\'t have much to say about the shops/food options.  I\\'m always amused to see the slot machines when I get off of the plane, although I prefer to do my gambling in actual casinos, it gives it that little Vegas flair.  It is a big airport, but not horribly difficult to navigate.  The trickiest part is figuring out where to go after collecting your luggage and sometimes the taxi queue can be crazily long (though it usually moves quickly).  If they would get the monorail extended down to the airport, that would be fantastic..I recommend the shop because these foods were so tasty!! The price was expensive for me, but there was enough value to eat, although I\\'m a binge eater. In addition, side dishes were free! I was glad to hear that and I asked for refills. I had a great time on my birthday! \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0.Then, the location is very convenient. There is near by Finch Station and next to Yonge Street. If you want to eat Korean food with your friends or your family, you should go there!!.I would like to recommend \" Camelback Eye Care\".I\\'ve been a patient there for over 2 years now.    The care that I recieve  there is outstanding.  .Dr. Dawn Heffelfinger listens to all my concerns and always offers alternatives, such as my concerns from glasses to contacts. Any eye concerns she will address.  The staff is exceptionally friendly and accommodating.  The office is emasculate.  They have a huge array of glasses to choose from.  .Everyone in the office is very professional..I cannot say enough wonderful things about this gem.  The food is comparable to your grandmother\\'s good old home cooking.  Michelle the server could not be nicer or more knowledgeable...and very sweet.  Omar  the manager is sincerely one of the best managers in Vegas. He stopped by and chatted with myself and my husband for quite a while.  .Such an amazing place all around.  You are missing out if you don\\'t go.Woo! Another Crepe place off the list. ..I\\'ve really yet to find a \"bad\" crepe, but these guys definitely reinforced what a good crepe should be. Nice, easy Sunday morning breakfast/brunch at 7th street market. I got the Chevre & Mozz and the lady got Berry Delight. Both were excellent. They did a fantastic job of filling the crepe to get your money\\'s worth, and the quality of ingredients plus inventive flavor combinations definitely makes this place 5 star worthy. I don\\'t have any complaints. Thanks for a great breakfast, Hazelnuts! We\\'ll see you again soon..takes forever at least 2 hour to connect the wifi. beef is last years. girls are last centry. salers are worse than none..The bbq, Mac and cheese and the bread pudding are very good. Hands down. I\\'m definitely coming back ..I had high hopes but won\\'t be coming back. Both wings and pork shank were dry - usually cooked too fast at to high a temp.  Beer was great. Service was meh. I\\'m sure this place is hopping after games but you\\'ll pay extra - pork shank was $27!  There are other better places nearby..Had the Cerviche de Cameron; the only taste was the kind that gets you to drink due to the heat, no real flavor, small portion; would not recommend. One TV at the bar was showing the 10pm News(!) the other one\\'s signal was not working. New only lasts so long..Dr. Gombert is the best! He\\'s been my dentist for the past 11 years and I couldn\\'t imagine going anywhere else for my dental needs. Dr. Gombert is patient, kind, and he does superb work! He treats all of his patients like they are his friends, not just patients, and his demeanor is calming. If you have any type of anxiety with dentists, then Dr. Gombert is for you! His cosmetic dentistry is gorgeous! I have several friends who have received veneers and cosmetic work and they look extraordinary! I refer all of my friends and family here. And, to make the experience even better the office is beautifully decorated, extremely clean, and the staff members are super friendly! Coming to this office you know you are in great hands! I highly recommend Dr. Gombert!.I like this place and plan to go back next year. But this is a sincere review, meant to be useful, and there was one thing that really bothered me (it\\'s explained at the end)...Yes, the office is swanky, especially the optical shop, as a prior reviewer noted. But don\\'t let this put you off.  And yes, there\\'s a bit of a \"sell\". It\\'s not aggressive, but it was strange that I would be encouraged to look at frames before my exam was over (while my eyes were dilating). I declined, saying I\\'d wait for the results of the exam and was not pressured at all. The optical shop is beautiful and the optician is very friendly. If you\\'re ordering contact lenses, the price is about what it is everywhere else. A little strange to see cosmetic services offered, but it did get me thinking that If I ever do get my eyebrows \"done\" it will be there...The actual exam was fine - and quick! The person who checked my correction and tested for glaucoma before the Dr. came in was very efficient. I would have said the whole thing was rushed, but that\\'s only in contrast to the exam process at UC Berkeley\\'s Meredith Morgan Eye Center, where I\\'ve been a patient for about 12 years and which is a teaching facility, so I\\'m used to being examined first and very very very cautiously by a 4th year Optom student and then having the supervising physician come in to check the student\\'s work. Dr. Perozek himself is efficient, competent and thorough. Right away he noticed something out of the ordinary and at the end of my appointment, he referred me to an endocrinologist to have my thyroid checked. At first I thought he did so based on my chubbiness, and was ready to explain that I really just eat too damn much, but then remembered someone in the past saying that big, um, protruding eyes can be a sign of a thyroid condition. I mean, I\\'m not Marty Feldman or anything, but the man\\'s got a point. I should check it, if only to rule out problems. My appointment\\'s later today. Trying not to think about it....Back to the actual review:.Overall, good experience. Kudos to Dr. Perozek for having a \"good eye\" re: my \"Betty Davis eyes\" and being stern in his encouragement to use eye drops to supplement my substandard tear production. He didn\\'t over-explain things to me. Very professional..So why not 5 stars? .Well, because I\\'m sad about something. At the end of the exam, when I went over to the sink to put my contact lenses back in, I saw the green intake questionnaire I\\'d filled out at the beginning of my appointment - in the trashcan! I can understand that a physician may not refer to it during an appointment (or even read it at all), but why have us fill them out only to discard them? And more importantly - why not shred it!? This is a question of confidentiality as well!! The questions were good ones and  addressing even one of them with a patient on his or her first visit would be a good way to build rapport (and clientele). I recommend either putting the questionnaires to use (someone spent a lot of time creating them!), eliminating them altogether or shredding them at the end of the day, after those sensitive soul patients have left :).I\\'ve been there a few times for breakfast and a few times for drinks. It\\'s a cool joint for live music. The crowd is friendly, very local feel. Terri took my order for a mocha and oatmeal. She took an order before and after mine before any drinks were started. When she called to me that the drink was ready I politely mentioned that I had ordered it iced. She literally ROLLED HER EYES AT ME, said nothing and continued to busy herself. When the iced version was ready she merely held it up and continued her phone conversation. No apology for the delay or a smile to smooth over her rudeness. The oatmeal was delivered by an adorable smiley girl named Tatum. It was as delicious as I recall. The \"plain Jane\" is $6 and comes w four toppings of your choice. I had black and blue berries & almonds and walnuts. The toppings were fresh the portions generous. Terri came to bus our table, said nothing, no smile. I stopped taking it personally when I saw this was her interaction w all the customers. I am sorry if she was just having a bad day. It\\'s a cool joint but I won\\'t rush back..Really 4-5 for food, but the service was slow and very scattered. Apparently they\\'ve been featured on a local PBS show and were not prepared for the influx of customers.  At one point there were probably 8 empty tables but had to put people on a 20 minute wait because they couldn\\'t handle what they had. A lot of what we ordered was answered with \"I think we\\'re out of that but I\\'ll check.\" Appetizer and entrees came out right behind one another which is a huge pet peeve of mine. Most of the entrees were luke warm since we were still working on the just arrived appetizer.  Although the food was very good. Very flavorful and great portion size. We split 2 entrees amongst 3 people.  Grilled bread which was served standard to all tables was very good although hard to enjoy with no napkins,  silverware,  or a plate to put our bread on.  Dessert took an extra long time to come out and very slow to clear the table. No check in on quality of meal, no drink refills offered.  I\\'m sure with some forward thinking, and some management on the floor they\\'ll get the service squared away. At least one can hope. Or it\\'ll go back to it\\'s sleepy state pre -PBS..This place has good facilities but pretty bad customer service. I am not looking for a best friend when I hit golf balls, but the last several times I have been there no one in the shop even recognized my existence until I was pretty much at the counter needing something. Another time when I went the ball machine jammed and when I asked the guy for help he pretty much made me feel like I had done something wrong. Instead of being apologetic or acting like he cared...He just dumped what balls the machine had given me 20 or so which he could have just as easily let me have, and just punched in a new code for more balls. Curtis in the repair area is pretty good and cordial whenever I need something, but he is about it in the shop that I have seen that really offers anything. Not my favorite place but the facilities are good and the hours work for my schedule..Really enjoyed having lunch at the meadows here that Ken Singh started.  Come, meet and talk with community people.   Great way to spend a few hours!  Love what Mr. Singh is doing..Well, I\\'m an AVID GH fan and have been waiting for this to open!  I live in SoCal so I\\'m pretty close to Vegas...We had to wait about 1-1/2 hours to get in...you stand in line (outside) and wait while they separate you into groups.  Each group has a guide, so you get a \\'guided tour.\\'..This experience was more like going to a fun house.  Low lighting, music enhancements, etc., trying too hard for ambiance or whatever.  My biggest problem is that you only get 1 hr. 20 min. \\'tour\\' through the mansion.  You miss SO much because you have to keep moving because the next group\\'s coming in.  And, it\\'s WAAAAYYY too expensive for what you get...I think he should enclose everything in glass (so no one can touch anything) and let you take your time.  The house does have some very small rooms, so when you\\'re with a group it\\'s kind of difficult to get to see everything...Definitely won\\'t recommend it, I\\'m sad to say..I needed a tuneup on used bike I purchased.  They did a great job on my bike even offered to cut off the old bike lock.  I like to ride daily if possible so they had my bike to me in a few hours.  The price was extremely reasonable especially living off of a students income.  First place I\\'ll go for my bike needs :).Look I like a little Greek once in a while they owner seemed friendly until I ask about my order his attitude was \"it is what it is.\"  I ordered the Shish Kebab Platter, I got my order in a fair amount of time but there were no vegetables except one small piece of tomato. I asked him about the picture and said where are all the other items, he said that picture on the advertisement is from the internet its not what i\\'m selling....I will find my wife Gyros some where else..Been here often and appreciate the service at the bar. Always welcoming and attentive to us whenever we dine or just have cocktails. A friend made reservations and we were seated before our reservation which was great! Manager was awesome enough to offer to carry our martinis when we made it to the top of the stairs. Our server introduced himself, Dylan! He was nice and friendly. To be honest service wasn\\'t great! Felt like we were a small party of 3 compared to his other two tables of 6 that were ordering bottles of wine. Decanters wine tastings that he was involved in with our 2 hours of dining there. Just wasn\\'t attentive because we were a smaller party? Not sure! Had to order our main course through the manager and the steak came our warm not hot. We sent it back to get it warmed up. Have been here plenty of times, overall not a great dining experience. We\\'ll just stick to the bar and spend the same amount of money! Better quality of service, bartender are catering, and food is hot! I\\'m not a picky person but am in the industry to understand and know what is expected..External Ambience: 5.Internal Ambience: 2.5 (had a weird smell) waiters were wearing jeans but it was giving off a fancyish vibe with the live jazzish music, food prices and fancy plates food..Food 2.75: my wife liked her sea bass but within an hour she was feeling uneasy in her stomach.  She has a gluten allergy and was told there was no gluten in the dish. My lamb shank was I guess what a lamb shank is (a hunk of meet with nothing green like broccoli, beans or salad) so I didn\\'t enjoy the dish, it was too 2 dimensional.Service: 3.5 the kid needs training, and doesn\\'t know the menu enough to make me feel confident. .Value: 2  the experience was lacking.  For the price I desire an experience and GREAT food, I got neither ..Try at your own risk, maybe I ordered the wrong thing and the service was an off night? I won\\'t be back..We love this place and always bring out-of-town friends and family. Hands down they have the best burgers in Las Vegas. Our favorites are the Shogun (with foie gras!) and perfectly seasoned Banh Mi burger. Also go for the Ox tail chili fries and the Pork belly buns...What impressed us more during our last visit is that they\\'ve expanded their menu. Must try are the North Shore Shrimp Truck (if you\\'ve ever been to Oahu and tried the shrimp trucks, you will know what this is about) and the Bone marrow jam (long bone cut longitudinally in half for you to scrape out the marrow\\'s fatty goodness). ..Just so happy with this place. So many things to enjoy on the menu. Haven\\'t even mentioned ramen menu from Shoku Ramen Ya which used to have its own entrance..Awful service for the second time! The fist time I had the rudest waiter with absolutely no personality and the second time I waited forever for everything! I waited to be seated in a close to empty restaurant because the host was MIA, I waited forever for my drink order, waited forever for the waitress to take my order, waited for my appetizer (which was served cold with my food) and was confronted with an attitude when I chased the busser down who kept passing my table by, to ask for a refill. They should really rename this place THE WAIT! needles to say, I will not return for this cold food, rude staff and long wait time!.I\\'m sure there\\'s not a major difference between most of the Dodd\\'s around town. But the flagship store is the biggest, and best in most regards...Except for their service. ..I visited the flagship Dodd store and was ignored completely for 20 minutes. Finally we left. But not the North Olmsted location. Yes, they have less inventory, but the staff there is friendly and comes right up to you to ask what you need help with. ..I\\'m new with this digital camera stuff, so I hardly believe I\\'m going to be visiting Dodd anytime soon knowing what I need. I\\'m going to need lots of help and guidance. The lack of that at the flagship store makes me want to never return and just stick with the smaller locations. ..Oh, and they had exactly what I needed, even with less inventory..When I was younger I had a saltwater fishtank. Over the years I have wanted to set another one up but haven\\'t had the time. After calling around to multiple aquarium stores and being quoted over $2500 for small setups, I found Chris. He is very helpful and had excellent prices on good condition used tanks. I just purchased an 80 gallon sump setup and Chris put everything together for me. Very affordable, helpful, and knowledgeable. I\\'m looking forward to what my tank can be with the help of Discount Aquarium Fish and Reef..Very authentic Szechuan fare. I love their steamed dumplings with chilli oil and noodle soups..This location has the best selection of clothes, books, electronics and more. The air conditioning could use some help, but the friendly workers make up for it..I have always wanted to come here and now that I have, I wouldn\\'t go back. .Food is way over priced. Quality is mediocre. I ate the fish and ships; the fish was doughy and the fries tasted old. .All you are paying for is to watch your servers be ass holes to the customers..The only thing I can say is I wish I worked there! for the servers it must be pretty cool to not worry about giving good customer service and receive excellent tips due to the high prices..I would recommend coming only once just to get rid of the curiosity..I would expect nothing less from the Mandarin Oriental, and they one-hundred percent delivered with this property.  ..The price was standard fare for what you would expect from a nice Vegas hotel.  The difference, however, came from the stellar property and amenities which made this trip more than noteworthy.  To begin, the property is immaculate; from the 23rd floor lobby/tea lounge/sky bar to the rooms to the pool/spa, everything is 5 star.  To begin with the room, the layout was small but packed with every luxury one would expect from an MO room.  The seperate foyer was a nice touch when getting ready to go out, the bed was beyond comfortable, and the bathroom was extremely luxurious.  I booked with AMEX Platinum so I got a spa credit (I would not have otherwise used the spa) but I was able to enjoy their day pass ($50 weekday/$60 weekend) -- it was totally relaxing and provided another way to enjoy Vegas.  That being said, I am not sure that I would have paid the price had I not had the credit, but If you are on the fence about whether to buy the day pass or not, know that it will leave you totally relaxed and ready to take on the night.  The pool area was nice and relaxing, the poolside restaurant was good and the cocktails were refreshing...There are two downsides to this property, obviously the prices for food/beverage are somewhat overpriced ($17 for a glass of Sangria poolside); that being said, this is a given at a place like this, so either accept it or pick another spot.  Secondly, MO is not a casino and it does not have the same hype some casinos might offer.  Think Encore but more tranquil and no party.  If you can accept that then it is MORE than worth the price, especially since it is a 5 minute walk to Aria and a 7 minute walk to Cosmo/Bellagio/etc.  Just know that you will have to go elsewhere to gamble and if you want to party poolside you will have to pay to go elsewhere to do that too.  But, the experience at MO has made me a believer that THIS is the way to do Vegas properly.  Maybe it\\'s cause I turned 30, but I\\'m about enjoying this relaxation where I stay and partying elsewhere as desired.  If that\\'s not your speed don\\'t pick this hotel.  If you do choose it you will NOT regret your choice..This was my first \"modern\" Italian food experience, and I was pleased. ..They started us with some rolls that tasted homemade with fruity olive oil and vinegar...I ordered the vegetarian lasagnette. It looked like a nest of pasta and was stuffed with artichoke hearts, eggplant, and cheese. The filling was enveloped by pasta that was wonderfully light and crispy from baking, and warm marinara surrounded the nest. It was simply delicious. I wish that I could make it at home, but I doubt that I have the skill to weave pasta into a dome!..My boyfriend ordered the short-rib ravioli. I didn\\'t try any ravioli, but he really liked them. The portion looked reasonable and they were quite pretty. ..As you can see, we only sampled a couple of the dishes, but my lasagnette was enough to give Fiamma 5 stars..Went Napoli because I got a flyer in the mail with a special 16 inch pizza for $8.99 which I thought was a good deal. When I arrived I ordered the 16 inch pizza with 1 topping of pepperoni along with 10 chicken wings hot and side of fries plus two beers total came to $29.21. The service was excellent had our pizza within 15 minutes, the table arrangement allows for a lot of foot traffic between tables people picking up takeout orders, which makes for a poor dining experience.  The Pizza was too salty and not good, hot wings were good, would not recommend this place, if their signature dish which is pizza is too salty..We\\'ve eaten at Browns Social a half dozen times over the last year. The service tends to be pretty good, atmosphere is always bustling. I\\'d say the food is above average, well thought out recipes but maybe not perfectly flavoured or spiced. It could be better. The overall experience is always quite positive which moves this from a 3 star to a 4 star. It\\'s well priced and I feel if the food quality improved a little this could definitely be a 5 star from me...They have decent gluten-free choices for those with or dinning with celiac individuals..This has been one of my top three coffee shops since I\\'ve moved to Pittsburgh. Hasn\\'t changed at all since my first visit. ..Good selection of coffees, beverages and cookies/desserts. They have a small outdoor patio, and the customers range from students, to young professionals and older. A varied, but interesting/cool mix...Definitely worth stopping by if you\\'re in the area, and want something locally owned that\\'s not a chain..I have been here several times and the place is really neat.  I love the interior and I agree that it is a very clean place.  The atmosphere is really nice and I enjoy going here with my family on Sunday afternoons...My favorite is the loaded nachos.  They are not like your ordinary nachos.  They are made with french fries, pulled pork, cheese, green onions and jalapenos.  They are really, really good.  My daughter likes them too...I agree with Heather\\'s review completely so I won\\'t repeat it.  So, if you get the chance to go here I would highly suggest you go..Would\\'ve given it four stars, but the wait service my friends and I received today takes down the rating a notch. Don\\'t get me wrong, I find no fault with the food or restaurant itself - it came in an efficient and timely manner, and it tasted decent - maybe not the greatest or cleanest (probably lots of MSG), but fair for the price paid. However, our waiter was quite disengaged in her service. Either she was having an extremely rough day, or was in a very foul mood because it seemed apparent that she didn\\'t want to be working (to be honest, she looked downright miserable - maybe she needs a vacation and/or self care), and it showed. She didn\\'t look at us as we ordered or delivered the food, didn\\'t crack a smile or a pleasantry, and when she served the ramen we ordered she actually chucked the bowls (of hot soup, mind you) onto the table. She also seemed like she wasn\\'t paying attention to who ordered what because she was giving the dishes we ordered to the person who didn\\'t order it at our table. Bad day or not, it was bad service - quite disrespectful honestly. I almost didn\\'t want to tip when paying. If my friends and I just wanted food, we could have gotten takeout, but for sit-in places, it should be expected that good customer service should be part of the experience... right? That\\'s why there\\'s gratuity payments (tips for service) on bills -  if there\\'s nothing to really \"thank\" them for, well... ..Regardless of today\\'s experience, I\\'m not going to hold it against Ajisen itself. I will give the restaurant another chance on another cold day...* I wish the restaurant was more spacious -- the table sizes can only comfortably accommodate for 1-2 people (tables) or 4 people (booths)..Great feel, great candy, and great service by Paul... Easy parking in back too!.Fast food is fast food. I don\\'t know if the Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwich is healthier than anything else, but it really does taste yummy. I have to remember to ask them to leave off the pickle. Oh, and the waffle fries. Awesome!..Drive through was quick and efficient. No complaints!.Splendid Olive Garden! Overall, Great restaurant, nice and great. The food sometimes isn\\'t good though. Sometimes they mess up and the food isn\\'t what I expect it to be. I have been to the one at Desert Sky Mall near 75th Ave and Thomas Rd and the newly relocated Metro Center location at I-17 and Peoria Ave, plus a location in San Diego.  I usually sit near the Emergency Exit. When the Red Lobster closed because it\\'s company Darden sold the land, I was surprised this didn\\'t close. Overall, Excellent location. If I were to give it a grade, I\\'d give it a A+, 100%..My wife and I usually dine here with a groupon deal and each time never disappoints. This is probably our favorite Shabu Shabu/ Sukiyaki spot in town. If your going to splurge, this is the place to do it. The service is prompt and very attentive.  Our server, Paul, was extremely friendly and answered all our questions. Everything you\\'ve heard is 100% true and then some! We usually order a few rolls of sushi and obviously the hot pot is the main event, and every time we go it\\'s top-notch -- broth seasoned perfectly and cuts of meat second to none. Don\\'t skip desert! The ice cream macaroons from California is out-of-this-world good, so save room on your main course!.From out of town and was looking for local pizza place.  Found this place.  Great pizzas and wings.  Owner was very nice, very clean..Alikhan offers great services the process was so smooth and quick, she helped us out with all the paperwork and made everything seem so simple. we\\'re just grateful that we went to AliKhan..8am in Vegas?  Half the city is still asleep...Praline truffle + piping-hot Americano woke me right up.  Love their clean & fancy chocolate display.  Cafe chairs setup right outside (but it\\'s odd to me that one can  enjoy yummy eats in a smoke-filled casino)...Bonus for easy-grab just a step from the room towers..Mani-Pedi\\'s for three (with my son and hubby) today!! Clean set-up here, this place is NOT cluttered, nicely organized!  Adequate ventilation and well maintained massage chairs.  Good selection of colors, didn\\'t see any cheap polish either. Great service too!  We will be back here whenever we\\'re in town!.The Durango location is the most beautiful and clean doctors office I have ever been to. I love walking in to see it so fresh and clean especially the operating rooms. I had my wisdom teeth pulled today and I was so nervous but Dr. Krieger and his amazing coworker who helped him (I totally forget her name) were AMAZING. They turned on my favorite music to comfort me and answered all my questions throught the entire process including my very first visit here. The office even called me later in the day after my extraction to ensure I was doing good and if I had any aftermath questions, I so appreciated that because I had tons. Every single person who works here geniuenly care about their patients and it shows. I highly reccomend Canyon Oral and Facial Surgery, you will not regret it..So we came in here and lots of empty tables but not one clean one.  So we cleaned off our own table and had to go to the bar to get a rag and get our drinks.  Then we ventured out into the casino and when we came back, same story.  Not one clean table.  Drinks are expensive enough you shouldn\\'t have to bus your own table.  Have not seen one waitress for the place!  Worst place we\\'ve been in Vegas so far!.I saw this place all over Instagram so I had to try it. I took a colleague for lunch and we both were super disappointed! His grilled cheese was burnt and my chicken sandwich was just boring. The fries were excellent though. I want to try again but it\\'s moved way down my list.This is a nice and clean nail salon, the nail tech are awesome, everyone here does a great job.  I LOVE CHLOE......With all of the stress and all involved in moving Rebecca made it very easy for us to get a storage for our possessions until we are able to move into our new home...thank you Rebecca for making it stress free and very easy to deal with......Danny.Tx/Nv.This is one of my favorite places in Vegas.  I\\'m very sad to see the on in Beverly Hills has closed.  The service was not very good as we had to wait a long time after being seated to even have anyone talk to us.  Service was just not up to standards. ..The food was very good and I was very happy with everything we ordered..Absolutely horrific customer service from an older blonde haired lady there on Thursday 3/2/17.  She was a little snappy and snarky with a lady in front of me, then when it was my turn to drop off my shipping prepaid package she was an absolute jerk.  Arguing with me about the box my package was in not being secure, etc. (It contained a hard backpack and was wrapped with 3M packaging tape very well on the outside).  Hopefully she is the owner, because I\\'m not sure why anyone would keep her as an employee.  Left and took my package to another FedEx location and they said it was fine, and it shipped..It was not that good I ordered sea food tacos the only thing I finished was the fries. This is the last time I get food from here. Waste of my $11.50.My mom was in the mood for honey walnut shrimp so she and I came here on a Wednesday afternoon on a whim. We had the Chinese broccoli, salt and pepper pork chops, honey walnut shrimp, and scallion pancakes. Everything we had was perfectly seasoned and delicious. Our server was busy but still very nice and attentive. Would definitely come back again if were in town..Found out about E & S Landscaping from a google search of local landscapers and I\\'m so glad I found them! Isaiah and his crew are very professional, accommodating, reasonably priced and do great work. They will now be my go-to guys for any landscaping service. I would definitely recommend them!.Yes the portions are rather small, but that\\'s the whole point of yakitori... Excellent food.. excellent selections.. excellent ambience....I wouldn\\'t mind going back again and again and again..Expensive? Yes. But considering where you are, worth it. Really great atmosphere, in nice weather it\\'s like looking out at the ocean. The only other real rooftop destination right now is Azure, which I actually enjoy but this is like Azures grown up higher up more mature cousin. Can\\'t wait to return! Small food menu but the perfect spot for a nice drink and small plate to snack on. Fun tip- walking to the bathroom you feel like you might fall right out of the building..awful and ditsy, the man gave me a direct answer then when speaking with the female painter she said a different price and story, she had a hard time committing to a time and was very wishy washy. I don\\'t know how their painting is but their business sense and professionalism was a thumbs down. my first bad review ever but sorry you want me to wait to see if you can schedule a time to do an estimate? when I called them out they had the nerve to call me difficult, its not hard make an appointment if you\\'re booked say you\\'re booked. I\\'m artist but doesn\\'t mean you don\\'t need common sense..This place was lovely and the food was very good. My shrimp and crabmeat salad was so good that I wish the dish would be a bit bigger.. yummy taste though..The service was very good and tables were nicely separated from each other. Loved the ladies room and the artwork there..This place is pretty pricey so I picked my birthday to come here. I was afraid it would be stuffy, but it actually seemed like a place you could go to every night (if you are loaded). The place has a robust and homey feelling atmosphere and the tables are not seated to close together so you can have a private conversation. There is lots of foie gras on the menu and also game. My bf had the bison ribs and it came out on a rib that must have been like 2 feet long. I had lamb shank which was very tasty. .I went to the bathroom, and there was a TV in there and lots of beer on ice. I asked what it was for and was told that it was so you could catch a bit of the hockey game, there was an important game on. You could lock yourself in there and sit and drink beer and watch the game - how great is that! Sort of a quirky idea, awesome. I was surprised there was no line..There seemed to be a lot of regulars, our waiter seemed to stop for little chats here and there..Definitely a last resort. Came here on a whim to see what they had to offer; I wasn\\'t impressed. The food was very limited in options and not very well cooked, extending  into the dessert selections, which were actually O.K, but again not very diverse or well prepared. I\\'m not coming back even for free..Horrible experience. Will never shop at hhgregg again. Purchased washer dryer expecting them a specific delivery day. Was not told it would only be delivered *if* it came in. It didn\\'t come in. We weren\\'t even called. We only bought through them because we were told by the associate that we were guaranteed that delivery date. ..Just go anywhere else..I don\\'t like to give a low review, but the customer service and the wait time for their product is ridiculous...I had ordered a Buckwheat Hull night pillow and did not receive the product for over a month.   Numerous emails and voice messages to the company regarding my order and not one response, nothing, zero...The pillow did finally come after a month and seems to be a quality pillow, but do to their customer service I will never purchase a product from the company again.  I basically believed that I had been scammed by this company,  and my suspicions grew greater when they would not return any emails or voice messages when I attempted to find out what had happened to my order...This was a learning lesson for me though and next time I want to buy a product on line I need to check the reviews first!.Who knew this hidden gem could be found inside the SouthPark Mall!? If you love pizza, you must give Gusto a go. Here\\'s what I had:..Obey The Claw Pizza-holy delicious. This pizza was beautifully flavored and cooked to perfection. I haven\\'t had many seafood & pizza combinations which had me questioning my culinary choices. This pizza consisted of roasted red pepper pesto, charred golden beets, mozzarella, fontina, jumbo lump crab, roasted corn, red onions, old bay, topped with micro basil and creamy parmesan drizzle. This is a seasonal pizza, so get it while you can!..Watermelon Salad-not a fan. The flavors didn\\'t mesh well. The watermelon and pickled beets were way too sweet and needed a sour/salty element to break it all up...All in all, go for the pizza! I\\'ll be back to try an alternative pizza option very soon..$85 after tax and tip for two appetizers, two mains, two desserts, and a beer. We were stuffed. ...APPETIZER: Brussels Sprouts ($7).--------------------------------------------------\\xad\\xad---------------------.Smoked Cheese Sauce, Parmesan, toasted mustard seed. Pretty tasty. A little cheesy, a little salty. ..APPETIZER: Buffalo Cauliflower ($8).--------------------------------------------------\\xad\\xad---------------------.Beer battered cauliflower, buffalo hot sauce, ranch dressing. SO GOOD. Standout out of all the dishes. Unfortunately, looking at other Yelpers\\' pictures, it seems like either it\\'s not regulated or they\\'ve shrunk the portion, but we got maybe 10 pieces. It didn\\'t really fill the plate, but other Yelpers\\' pictures look like they\\'re about to overflow. Delicious nonetheless...MAIN: Chicken & Waffles ($16).--------------------------------------------------\\xad\\xad---------------------.Crispy chicken, sour cream, spicy maple, green onion, sourdough waffles. A waffle sliced diagonally sandwiching three pieces of boneless fried chicken. The syrup was great. Not too spicy or overpowering. The sour cream was an interesting addition. Can\\'t say it added much, but I like sour cream. The chicken was crispy and could\\'ve been a tad juicier, but it was delicious nonetheless...MAIN: Home of the Brave Burger ($13).--------------------------------------------------\\xad\\xad---------------------.House ground ribeye, HOTB pickle mayo, House American cheese, Tomato, Lettuce. I don\\'t like pickles or pickled things, but I didn\\'t taste anything overpowering. The burger was just delicious. I don\\'t like when burgers don\\'t come with any sides. I don\\'t consider it a complete main course and a bit of a money-grab, but the burger was good though. ..There are actually more desserts than are shown on their website\\'s menu. We had these two:..DESSERT: Fluffer Nutter ($6).--------------------------------------------------\\xad\\xad---------------------.Twist, peanut butter sauce, marshmallow coated ruffles, peanuts, white & milk chocolate. Lots of peanuts. That\\'s the predominant flavour with this ice cream cone. The first few bites were like peanuts, peanuts, chocolate, and more peanuts. They give you a dish so that you can lay it sideways and eat it with spoons because I bet it\\'d get messy otherwise. The ruffles aren\\'t that prominent, but the chunks that you do find are delicious. ..DESSERT: Red Velvet Funnel Cake ($8).--------------------------------------------------\\xad\\xad---------------------.Red velvet batter, fresh berries, cream cheese icing, sweet Jesus vanilla soft serve. Way too sweet and I usually like sweet stuff like white chocolate. Maybe they\\'ve improved the batter because despite other reviews, the funnel cake was not hard at all. It wasn\\'t fully crispy either. I guess it was a comfortable middle. The cream cheese icing is overkill. With the ice cream, the dish is already sweet. The icing makes the dish unbearably sweet. Everything else was pretty good. ..I was satisfied with every dish with the exception of the icing on the funnel cake. The portions weren\\'t huge (despite our server\\'s warning), but I think you could comfortably share an appetizer with someone, have your own main, possibly skip the dessert, and be satisfied. We ordered everything just cause we wanted to try it all. ..Aside from the obvious choice of fried chicken and waffles, the buffalo cauliflower was a clear standout. Would definitely recommend that one..great local tavern. and i have to say it, since today is st. patty\\'s day, it\\'s not an irish bar. mickey was german through and through. his name wasn\\'t even mickey! it was milton...anyway, they\\'ve got good stuff on tap: guinness, futhermore proper, new glarus spotted cow, shiner bock, leinies original, lakefront\\'s cream city pale ale, bells two hearted ale, and capital\\'s seasonal. plenty of bevvie\\'s in bottles; too many to list them all here...(edit: 4/25/08: shiner is gone, in its place is good ol\\' pbr.)..they\\'ve also got daily drink specials and frequent live music. if you\\'re into irish jams, there\\'s a group that comes in every wednesday at 8p. the jukebox selection should suffice anyone\\'s desire for tunes...(edit: 01/21/08: irish jam is over at the end of january)..there\\'s a patio in back with tables and chairs; and heaters for the smokers who want to go out when it\\'s cold. inside are a pool table, pinball machine, and darts for those who don\\'t want to belly up to the bar...(edit: 01/21/08: pinball and darts have been removed to make room for dining tables.)..rumors of a kitchen-in-progress are true, but timing hasn\\'t been finalized. stay tuned for bar-food-ala-janey (of lazy jane\\'s cafe)...(edit: 01/21/08: delicious meals are now available! burgers, salads, sexy fries [slices of potatoes smothered with truffle oil and parmesan cheese], mac n cheese, pork sandwiches, and yummy soup.)..(edit: 4/25/08: now serving brunch on saturdays and sundays! they open at 10. excellent bloody marys, vegetarian benedict, breakfast burrito, salmon scramble, and janey\\'s yummy waffles with peaches & cream.)..and remember, tipping isn\\'t a city in china!.Never thought I\\'d review a dentist but I love this dentist..My husband and I now keep The Smoke Pit in our back pockets for when guests or company comes to town and we want to show off Concord. We know that going at peak times mean that the lines will be long but the food is worth it! The portions are huge (I mean two full meals worth of left overs huge) and the flavor is great..The wedding and service up to the day of was great!! The only thing I would suggest to anyone planning to get married here is to make sure you read ALL of the paperwork. First there are no outside pictures allowed. Meaning none of your guest can take pictures on the property! Secondly don\\'t buy any floral arrangements on your own. They\\'re not allowed. You can only use there\\'s, which of course is for a fee. Last but not least the packages for the pictures are ridiculously priced..... we paid $351 for the slideshow and three posed pictures  Exactly.... it\\'s a lot!! Oh and the 19% charge on everything!! ..Oh and they move quick. They will get you in and out of there fast.... no socializing or anything. Smh.... I didn\\'t  really get a chance to even hug my guest who flew all the way from Chicago to Las Vegas just for my wedding!!.food poisoning. i ordered the chicken burrito and half the stuff that comes with it wasn\\'t even inside. how do you get my order wrong and give me food poisoning at the same time? my bf ordered the california burrito and said it was no where as good as it used to be. friendly staff and clean dining room but that does not make up for the horrible experience i had.One of the places I miss in Scottsdale. Very good burgers, typically friendly service..I\\'m hesitant to leave this review because right now I think this is a little hidden gem. But I can\\'t help sharing this awesome place!..Best pho I have had in a long time! I\\'ve been twice and tried both the beef and chicken satay pho and both were excellent. The broth is amazing. Also had the shrimp salad rolls which were tasty and fresh. Will be coming back here whenever my pho craving hits! The environment is modern and clean. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. Service was very fast and very friendly both times (one time was also during the weekday lunch rush). Highly recommend this place! Online ordering too!.Death In Venice recently started making all their baked-goods & pastries in-house, and they are AMAZE-BALLS..Best financiers I\\'ve had in my lifetime..The brookies (brownie + cookie) are super succulent, rich, and delicious..The scones.. *drool*.The staff was very pleasant. The food was mediocre. I had pizza and wings. I will liking not return..Love there ice cream is the best staff is so friendly n helpful will return for more for now my best ice cream place.I ordered bunch of food for birthday. Called and I\\'m not so familiar since I\\'m not Filipino. Lady was RUDE when I asked for help. She HUNG UP on me and when I called back she wouldn\\'t answer the phone. Is that a good business? Is that how you treat people who respectfully asked for help and guidance for food? Sad..I want their pizza now!!! and the garlic knots. they have the BEST GARLIC KNOTS!!! their steak pizza is delicious. I say get a full sheet and split the two half to try different pies. (yes I like to try a lot of different things) . I just wish they had a delivery guy so my work would always order from them. .they also carry a nice selection of draft beer. microbrews. .PARKING LOT ISSUES - IT IS TINY. the place isn\\'t really that big either but itd be nice to have more parking space..Amazing ice cream place In town. Friendly environment and knowledgeable staff. Customize according to your taste and desire..Great service. Easy to call ahead and pick up. The food is solid quality no fatty or over breaded deep fried chicken. The sauces taste great teriyaki, orange, and hot teriyaki. Sometimes the chicken can be oily that\\'s why 4*.Wow I can not say enough great things about this place and the people who work there! Even tho the actual repair took awhile (had to wait on a part) everyone was so nice and more than accommodating! They gave us a ride to a hotel. let us borrow a car the next day so we could go grab lunch. They complimented my children\\'s behavior and gave them candy. Kept me informed. The dealership was clean, spacious, and comfortable..Even in Vegas a world of buffets nothing comes close to the quality! DEVI IS AMAZING! High quality, clean and superb staff! A little off the beaten path but perfect. Also open till 3 am. Love this place..Our first visit with friends who recommended it. Great food and service. I would\\'ve given five stars but we felt like we were rushed from the time we sat down. We had a sitter, so we were trying to take our time. The chimichanga roll was really good. We split the shrimp and steak dinner and added an extra soup/salad: miso soup wasn\\'t miso soup, broth with a slice of mushroom and a green onion so that was a bit disappointing cause I love a good miso soup! The salad was good. The chef was funny and great at his job!.This is the third time I have used Liberty Tree and they have done a great job.  They were competitively priced, arrive on time, trees and yard look great when they are done.  It\\'s hard to find good service in this industry but I have been nothing but pleased with their service..BUYER BEWARE!! WORST salon experience I have ever had. I can honestly say I have no idea how this salon has obtained a reputation as being a top salon with celebrity clientele. Color alone took upwards of seven hours and the result was over processed grey ashy damaged hair. The stylists have zero concern for what you want nor do they care about the health of your hair. They leave bleach on there for wayyy too long, which has resulted in my hair falling out(not unlike some of the other customers who have posted on here). My hair fell out in clumps after washing two days after visiting the salon. The damage to my hair is irreparable and I now have to spend thousands of dollars on treatments and extensions to hide the the severe breakage. The owner has zero regard for customer service and takes zero responsibility for the poor training of her stylists. This salon is run like an assembly line and the master stylists just pass you along to the assistants so they can maximize their income without concern for the integrity of your hair or your desired results, all while charging you high-end prices for low end work..I have told every friend and family member I have to NEVER take their vehicles to Munro to get fixed, especially this location. My husband took his car in for a blown radiator hose the end of October 2014, it\\'s now April 2, 2015 and while I was driving his car today, the hood started billowing with steam/smoke (Ironically enough less than a half mile from this Munro- that same place that fixed it 6 months ago). We opted to take our vehicle to a different shop this time due to the obvious reason of the shotty work that was done on our vehicle at munro in October. When we got the vehicle to the other shop we chose, before we could even tell them what had happened, they specifically asked if we had the radiator fixed recently. They asked because the new hose that was installed 6 months ago was NOT CLIPPED IN PROPERLY (are you kidding me- clipped in? I\\'m pretty confident that even I could clip something in properly), and the radiator itself was not secured correctly- leaving the radiator flapping back and forth as we were driving for the last 6 months. Munro charged us nearly $400 to do a job improperly, and now 6 months later we have to get the entire radiator replaced for near the same price that Munro charged us for a simple hose replacement 6 months ago. I cannot stress how disappointed I am with munro\\'s customer service and lack of being able to repair a car properly, when that is exactly the reason they are in business- to repair cars. If I could give them 0 stars, I would. Please don\\'t waste your time or money taking your vehicle to Munro muffler!.This place is great! We are from California and love Lush so decided to check out Nectar. The products are adorable (albeit a bit on the pricier side)..The associate Vic was amazing and definitely made the experience one of a kind. She is the best!.Really good Pizza place in Montreal. Pizza price around 14$ which is enough to fill someone..Highly recommended to take clients to lunch there..Got takeout early on a Friday evening,  The lady got hummus, (her opium), and stuffed grape leaves. She was not a fan of either.  She hadn\\'t eaten all day, and a few bites of each was more than sufficient to sate her appetite.  I got the sampler platter which included a stuffed grape leaf, a phylo triamgle stuffed with spiced spinach, a cheese stuffed phylo triangle, some gyro meat, tzatsiki sauce a few pita wedges and a small side salad.  It sounds like more than it was, as the triangles and grape leaf were all smallish.  Nothing was all that wonderful.  There were insufficient sauce and pita wedges for the gyro meat.  I\\'m a fan of independent restaraunts, but I doubt I\\'ll return..Aladin\\'s is the same distance from our house and beats them hands down..I have crossed half the city by streetcar just to satisfy my cravings for Sweet Bliss\\' cupcakes. The icing has the perfect texture, thick and sugary but yielding, while the cake is light and flavourful. The chocolate ones are particularly devastating....Various other baked goods are also available (larger cakes, loaves, pies and so forth)..I honestly can\\'t believe what gets 4 stars sometimes. This place is so so at best, down right bad at worst. The staff have clearly not been trained to do food or drinks, and have no idea what they\\'re doing. The one guy who did know something couldn\\'t focus long enough to finish anything. ..There were maybe 5 people in the place when we got there and it took 15 mins to get two americanos that were weak but drinkable. A group of 5 came in and ordered drinks right when my friend ordered a sandwich. Then things really ground to a halt. ..After waiting 25 minutes my friend was informed thy it\\'d be another 20 minute wait for his food. For a sandwich. He also said \"we\\'re really not equipped for big orders\". Umm. Then don\\'t offer food...Not going back, with so much good food and drink all over the neighbourhood, I highly recommend you go ANYWHERE else..This is one of my favorite places to eat Asian cuisine and is very reasonably priced. This is my go-to place for sushi, as well as Chinese style food since I live in uptown. The quality of food from their \"From the Wok\" menu completely blows away any Chinese takeout you\\'ll find around here for roughly the same amount of money. I\\'d recommend this establishment to anyone looking for great experience in both quality and service..Nice and relaxing atmosphere, as well as very nice folks running the place.  Acupuncture that is affordable and staff is very knowledgable without being pushy.  ..David is one of the realest people I\\'ve met in ages.  Can\\'t recommend enough.  Support these good people!.There were a few bugs in the beginning but new management so far is doing a great job still waiting for my fence out front but they are polite and the complex is small so everyone is friendly.pool is nice only down side is the gym is not open 24 hours and you have to do laundry in a facility that they provide apartment is decent as long as you make it what you want.Amazing service and friendly atmosphere.  The coffee is always consistent and flavorful.  The pastries are always fresh.  I can\\'t wait for more locations to open up..I got my hair done here a couple weeks ago. I spent $200 and my hair doesn\\'t look good at all. It took 2.5 hours for the girl to make my hair just look like my roots grew out really bad. For this kind of money I expected a lot better. The color doesn\\'t look any different it looks like she just darkened my roots and the rest looks the same. I\\'ve had my hair dyed several times and never had it take this long or be so unhappy with the result..A go-to for consistently good food,  service, and fair prices. Not a health food restaurant by any stretch, nor is it gourmet.  Salads are very fresh tasting and there\\'s no skimping on meat or toppings! Soups are terrific. Really, no \\'bad\\' choices here although I can\\'t say I recommend the grilled cheese.  I do think their chicken Alfredo is, quite possibly,  worth the certain cardiac death.  It\\'s SO good..I had Charnell as my Wax Specialist and she was fantastic! She was very professional and also made sure that I was happy with my wax results. If I had to come back to this location I would come back to see her as well as recommend her to my fellow Yelpers! Great location with a Starbucks within walking or driving distance to wax center..Roots at the corner facing Britannia road and connected to marks on the east and on north under armour. Parking is huge and shared for most of the stores. However, you will not get more discount options here. Yes they do have choice in babies clothing mens and women. Winter stuff from roots is always preferable good closest place in the neighbourhood..This is one of those places that I really wanna hate but just can\\'t!  In my heart, i don\\'t believe any candy deserves its very own four story megastore in the heart of the Las Vegas strip.  And everything is so damn overpriced! 13 bucks for a pound of m&m\\'s? I dont care what color they are, they\\'re all gonna be the same color in the end =0..So why am I giving this place 4 stars? Look around......everyone has a smile on their face. At least we can drop a hundred bucks here and get something out of it, unlike the blackjack tables.  Hell, they even have a free 3-D show that aint that great but it will give you something to do after you blow all your money at Bills Gamblin\\' Hall. And if you\\'re quick enough, you can take home a pair of souvenir 3-D glasses!.Definitely a discount shoe store. Boxes up to the ceiling, but I guess I should expect that being at the outlet mall. Wasn\\'t very organized though... corresponding shoes not on the right shelves. It was Sunday, so maybe it was a bit busy for everything to be sorted...The cashier at check-out was very friendly. She didn\\'t suggest I get a 2nd pair for half off like they normally. Guess I saved a little money. Usually doesn\\'t happen with shoe shopping ;).bought a cat nail clipper by cash and found my own clipper. I took the it back without opening the package and the woman works there was so rude...Will never go back, unbelivable!.I decided that since I have my cosmetology license I should start using it again and one good start would be doing my own nails and for friends and family. I heard this is a great nail supply so I drove over from Henderson months ago to get some supplies. Now let me say, nails were never my speciality, hair was, but I\\'m ready to learn again,  so I go, ask the guys working there questions, and they are nothing but super helpful! Should I get this? What about this? I mean very helpful! I\\'m so impressed! Then the really nice guy rings me up.......and gives me the total and I say \"what!?!?\" \"Are you sure? It\\'s such a great price!\" It\\'s for real! I love this place! I came back again and again for a few more colors over the next few weeks and today I met Tee, and I just loved Tee, I brought my Mom and my Mom loved Tee, she was awesome! She is so helpful, and so nice, ready for tips, ready to give advice, and this is so rare these days to get such awesome customer service, and here is the best part, they were not even open today, we just walked in! Tee said we are closed but she would still be happy to help us! Xoxoxo.went back here last night and the service was extremely slow.  in fact our waitress may have been tipsy.  ..we waited for a solid 20 minutes before receiving menus.  we asked for drinks at least 3 times.  thankfully, our food was good and made it out after we ordered at a somewhat normal pace.  ..the calamari was good and enormous in portion.  it comes with a side of marinara with red pepper flakes.  i liked the kick.  it\\'s garnished with sweet peppers and pamesean cheese.  yeah for the calamari!  hence the 3 stars..The best poutine in gta, and very on par with Quebec. .If you tey it once, you\\'ll be back again and again, like me when I get to Queen street in Toronto.I thought I was being treat great because of their customer service, I was wrong. I was treated right because I was spending thousands of dollars here. Everything was great until their collections department called me because I forgot ONE payment and would not allow me to pay online and forced me to pay on the phone. After all that I have spent, they were worried about a hundred and something payment. Well I guess I will not continue to shop here anymore. THANKS FOR THE DISRESPECT! I\\'ll take my business elsewhere. It wasn\\'t like I didn\\'t have the money, I just forgot. I was insulted more when I was offered a minimum payment and not the full amount that was now due. I guess the person was \"surprised\" that I had all of the money. Are you kidding me, if you seen my account and how much I spent there would say otherwise...... Loyalty and customer service is a joke. At least I know where to go for my warranty coverage!.Thank goodness for You Buy and We Fly. .Jessie Martinez.Tricia Beliso..Brought me much needed Vietnamese fare for my flu :..Pho.Chicken and Rice porridge .Hot tea ..PLUS went and bought me Theraflu AND NyQuil. (So the ever-sweet Annette Randy wouldn\\'t have to bring me meds all the way from her house.)..THANK YOU KIND FRIENDS. ..It is not lost on me how special you are..Customer service and work is amazing. They went out of their way to ensure the work was done correctly. Would totally recommend having work done. Brandy is a pleasure to work with.The old Imperial Hotel modernized. Very trendy atmosphere with loud music, trendy decor, and many technological features. .Tech-ky: web check in can be done on you phone. Pick up keys at hotel. Also kiosks near front desk where you can check in. Keys are dispensed upon completion of check in. ..Valet pick up: scan ticket and wait outside for car; only interaction is when car is delivered. .Concierge: upon check in, received automated text welcoming you here and if you need anything from more towels or even asking a question about the linq, text back and you\\'ll be helped. This service is pretty cool. ..Negative: resort fees $34.01/day which includes WiFi and gym access. If I won\\'t use it, why pay for it?..Really like this hotel since it\\'s very different than other one in Vegas. It\\'s located right in the heart of the strip and easy to get to other casinos..This place was very little help to my son. They basically watched him detox and let him go. There is no long term goal for people that are not extremely sick or for people that have no money. Dont waste your time..one of the best in Vegas... if you haven\\'t made the trip... you need too... SO MANY GOOD THINGS, YOU CANT GO WRONG!.Each time we call later in the evening, or show up at the store, the staff acts inconvenienced at our inquiry. I have also had the same pizza \"special\" made incorrectly with my last two orders. Tonight, I was put off by the threat on the phone that the driver was \"on a delivery\" and that my order would be \"super late\" if I still wanted delivery. Apparently,nothing can be ordered after 10:30 p.m. for delivery. I find it awkward that I\\'ve had the feeling we were keeping staff awake with each late night visit or inquiry. Owners, please evaluate your staff, because it will be your demise in the Summerlin market. Your food is decent for pizza take-out, make sure your staff is decent as well..Great feel! Great breakfast! Pleasant service! Down home feel! They let me make up my breakfast exactly the way I wanted. Fresh squeezed orange juice!! Sooooo glad we stopped here! Sat outside!.My siblings and I had dinner here today June 27th 2017. It was 5 of us plus a child.. everyone sent their dish back except my sister and I (and she didn\\'t finish her food). They complained about the food being basic and tasteless.. I generally review for outstanding food and superb service. So I\\'m saddened to leave such a crappy review for a small business. My siblings had to be polite and explain it was their first time eating Jamaican food. I\\'m not sure where the great reviews are from but hey.. there\\'s literally no taste to the food and the cakes which are $4.50 a piece are DRY! Very sad day for our palates. Plus my oxtails barely had meat! It was all bone.. Save your palate and get your Jamaican food some place else..Came in for grand opening night with a few friends. Boteco is a new wine bar and tapas concept that should fit in great in this plaza, a welcome addition that offers class and creative cuisine in an area anchored by Twin Peaks and lunch-hours-only options. .. Chef Rachel\\'s globally-inspired menu features several dishes with Asian influence, from a trio of bao generously loaded with pork belly to a Thai crab \"dip\" with prawn crackers that riffed in ceviche, and more of a European influence in the bite-size Escargot Croquetas. The Avocado Crunch salad I ordered reminded me of gazpacho, would make a refreshing summer option on their soon-to-open patio...Other than the eats, Boteco has a selection of interesting wines from around the world as well as a weekend brunch (foie gras benedict and champagne pancakes!) and a monthly tasting menu dinner ($65/pp). Don\\'t forget to try a dessert: the salted caramel bundino was our favorite...The service provided great information and enthusiasm for the dishes but unfortunately some fell flat, not matching descriptions or simply underwhelming. Will return once they settle in more, has lots of promise..Came here for the PC Pavilion. I think I got lucky because it was raining the day I came here so, the pavilion was empty...But, when I left there were two people waiting behind me. How lucky! Maybe because the rain lifted as I was strolling here too...I checked out the grocery loblaws upstairs, and it is pricey like the longo\\'s near ACC. Was alright!.Great breakfast place! Ordered the egg and bacon plate. Very very good fresh bread served with your meals. Service is friendly and warm. Definitely coming back..This place was great! Although there was a wait to be seated, the food & hospitality was worth the wait. I\\'d come before 9am, if you want to beat the crowds. Our chili/cheese & Greek omelette were superb! Flavors just sang! The side of the homemade biscuits & gravy was delectable. Wouldn\\'t mind coming here to try their lunch menu next time!.Rude service and employees! I places an order by phone for the carside to go service. I drive into the spot for take out orders and I\\'m sitting there for 10 mins. I called to see why hadn\\'t anyone been out to give me my order and the guy told me to just come in. I have been to chilis in 2 other states and the servers always come out to give customers their orders. What\\'s the purpose of having carside at this location if they force you to come in and pick up your order? The server was beyond impolite and I defiantly will not return to this location..Gina is a delight to work with and a faux floral genius! I used her for my August wedding and people raved about my flowers. No one could tell they were fake! They turned out beautiful and just the way I wanted. Gina sends you pictures along the way and I had my flowers at my house complete and ready to go in March and my wedding was not until August. I also had to order a few extra arrangements closer to the wedding and it was no problem. Gina is so friendly and personable too and will make you feel like you\\'re an old friend. I highly recommend Gina!.Got the tickets for free but if I were to buy these tickets I would, I did have an amazing time! Although I wouldn\\'t by front row or the first 10 rows or something because you can see pretty clearly in any part of the theater. First row of the mezzanine row is pretty good seats already! Blue man group does go around the audience and plays around with them and also picks a few volunteers so just be ready for that just in case they do pick you. ..You\\'ll definitely have a good time laughing and trying to figure out what comes next. I do feel like... This show is very random because after one segment they just go to the next and they dont really go together like a story would, but you will laugh but I wished their segments would tie in together and I would of probably gave them 5 stars instead of 4. ..DONT FORGET!! be on the casino floor like 45 mins early or 30 minutes earlier prior to the show because the blue man group band goes around and does a little parade and once that\\'s over, they open the doors right away. Quick and fast entering into the theater which is nice!.Pretty simple review. Fantastic east Indian restaurant. Great atmosphere, staff and some really great dishes. We will be back for more..I\\'ve never rated anything on Yelp until now because this place deserves it! Incredible food, great wine list and excellent vibe with the open kitchen. If you\\'re ever in Charlotte for one night... GO HERE. You\\'re welcome..My tire pressure light kept coming on. Even after I filled them all with air, a day or two later, the light would come on....after returning from getting air, I pulled into my garage just right, and saw that on my rear passenger tire, I had a screw...Discount tire is easily the closest shop to my house, so I made an appointment for this morning for their \"free flat repair\"...I arrived at 1030, and was greeted by a gentleman before I even got out of my car. He was very kind and we made conversation, outside and inside of the building...I sat, and was playing around on my phone after my car was handed off and \"checked in\". About ten minutes went by, and a mechanic came in. He looked at me, and said, \"miss, did you happen to want a water..?\"..Miss...? I feel so classy!.The kind red headed man with black and red nikes handed me a bottle of water (could have been a little colder) but I won\\'t complain...Ten minutes later, My car is pulled up, I am given a sheet of paper, and sent on my way...Twenty minutes to fix a flat, rotate, and make sure that all my tires have appropriate air...? Yeah, I\\'ll be coming back, and I\\'ll be coming back for services that I actually HAVE to pay for..People always seem to be looking for a good restaurant for parties...Well, look no further. This is your joint. Reasonably priced food, huge variety, top-notch service, moody atmosphere and delicious meals can all be found here. And bonus! There is none of this faux \"birthday cake plating fee\" to be found here! ..I booked the Harlem Underground a couple weeks in advance for a birthday party. I ended up getting a couple of calls from them leading up to the reservation to clear up some confusion (such as... \"what time again? which sunday? are you still coming?\"), which braced me for a possibly just-as-confusing meal. However, upon arrival, the lovely staff worked their magic to juggle our party of 25+. Everyone\\'s meals came out within the same amount of time, drinks were flowing steadily (as was water), and the servers always had a smile on their face. They spoke passionately about the food and when it came time for it, happily brought the cake out with plates and cutlery, candles blazing. The chef himself even came out to wish the bday boy many happy returns...Food is great. I tried the hush puppies (fried fish balls) to start - and while it was satisfying, was a little on the bready side. The Bourbon Baby Back ribs were a winner - fleshy, tangy and sweet. If you\\'ve never had fried chicken and waffles, try it here. There is just the right amount on the plate and it\\'s a winning combination. The chicken itself was crispy and unbelievably juicy inside - a goal! ..With so many yummy things to choose from - I (and the rest of our party) agree that we\\'ll be coming back here for some more southern lovin\\'..I\\'ve been here a few more times and had a couple of meals, so am updating the review. ..The food is strictly pub fare, with wings, burgers and sandwiches. I had a chicken sandwich called the drunken bird or something like that, and a steak sandwich. ..The sandwiches are really good and pretty big servings. They come with either fries or chips, and I like their chips, which are homemade, not out of a bag. All sandwiches on the menu are $7.50, a good price. ..Overall, this is a nice neighborhood pub..I can\\'t say enough wonderful things about Sarah. She was so attentive and sweet. She has a bright, welcoming, kind personality. You can tell that she loves what she does. I\\'ve never colored my hair before and I am so happy to have gone to her to finally do it.  My hair has never looked better. The color looks incredible and natural. The cut is fierce and stylish. I feel beautiful and amazing. I will never go to anyone else for my hair..One of the best ramen places that I\\'ve been to.  The most important factor for me when I dig into ramen is that first bite with the combination of broth, ramen, and meat and this was AWESOME.  Their shio ramen is a great first one to try on their menu as the broth is just so rich and good.  If you order a combo, it comes with a side dish and we had salmon roe with rice which was also quite delicious as well.  ..Overall, I\\'d definitely come back to this place for ramen if I\\'m in the area..Oh Popeyes! ..I have had Popeyes in America a few times and I thought we weren\\'t missing anything by not having it but now that we have it, I am glad we aren\\'t missing out! (That makes sense, right?)..The chicken is so good. I really like the breading, it\\'s that good old southern fried thick skinned chicken! It is well seasoned, both the mild and hot are equally delicious! ..I think what make Popeyes so good has to be the hot sauce and the biscuits! We don\\'t have any other fast food franchises that serve these items, I think! It\\'s definitely worth it to try Popeyes, maybe wait for the hype to die down, we waited about 20 minutes in line. ..The only thing I didn\\'t like was that the mashed potatoes already had gravy in it. And I am waiting for those amazing American pricing promos :).My kids and I love this play. It\\'s not too crowded, inexpensive, and best of all we can bring our own food. This is a great place when you\\'re in a budget but still able to enjoy family time under the sun..Parking\\'s always a pain, but you\\'ll have no problem if you head there before 6pm...I\\'ve always had incredibly fast service with reasonably tasting sushi. Today was slow. We waited 30 mins before getting any of our sushi orders. Keeping in mind there were only 5-6 small tables occupied...I love unagi, but their rolls barely had any. The flame combo is good bang for your buck with plenty of spice if you\\'re into that. I\\'m always a fan of the green tea they serve. I liked that they featured a new Japanese beer (can\\'t recall the name). ..Slightly higher price for the quality of sushi you get. Great vibe..Great food, even better service! Fun place to hangout, drink, watch sports. Huge thank you to the bartender Paige! Wonderful hospitality! Highly recommend going and seeing her!.Yummy sandwiches! I went to vegas knowing that I wanted to try this place out. We stayed at Planet Hollywood, so it was very convenient because they are open 24 hours. I had the Earl\\'s Club which I really liked. I also tried the Full Montagu. Both were very tasty. The lines go by fairly fast also. The bread is probably what stands out; it\\'s just perfect :).So Mike refused to give me an estimate on a 3 1/2 ton 92% furnace, saying he would lose his license. What an idiot. Obviously the 3 ton I have now is NOT working and what does he care that I want a 3 1/2 ton. Obviously he does not need my business. I would NOT recommend this company. They don\\'t like it when customers know their business better than they do!..I wrote this review BEFORE I spoke with David, the owner. As you can see from his response below, being a bully is part of their game plan. Yes, Renee was sweet and Craig was awesome and knowledgeable, but hurtling insults at me, a potential customer, is bad business. No wonder Michael is a jerk! Seems to be accepted. Very sad indeed..I had wanted to try Fresh burger for a long time. I really loved the burgers there and even the fries, which I usually hate..This place differs from Hero Burger and other burger places Ive tried because you can really tell they make the burgers on the spot. They had amazing flavours. My mouth is watering thinking about it..It is really expensive and the burgers are small.  That is the only downfall..I was a bit hungry after we finished eating..That being said, if I was in a treat yourself Kind of mood, i would definitely go back..Used these guys twice to rent a Uhaul for moving purposes. Had good experiences both times, however this past time I felt bullied to buy the insurance for the truck when I only drove it 2 miles. I ordered the truck online, and everything was ready and good-to-go the morning of. I would at least recommend using these guys for Uhaul rentals (though I can\\'t speak for storage rentals)..My boyfriend and I went here on a date, he almost didn\\'t make it out alive. ..First off I threw up in my mouth, the food was that bad. All the food was canned, frozen, boiled or bagged. If you don\\'t know what food should taste like than maybe you\\'d like this place. For the price it is not worth it, honestly I wish we had gone to McDonalds. Fast food is better quality and a better price. We were able to joke about the food till desert came, they didn\\'t even try to hide that it was a fruit cup! Please never eat here, don\\'t put yourself through this..Outback isn\\'t...bad...but what\\'s the point? For a chain it\\'s not bad, though. I\\'ll consider going if friends want to. And for the record, I agree with the previous reviewer that the Bloomin Onion is just disappointing on all levels. ..Maybe the ultimate problem is I never want a cheap steak. An expensive steak can be delicious, but if you\\'re not going to go balls out for an excellent cut of meat and preparation, there are so many more interesting things you can do with that same steak (I\\'ll take a steak huarache at Taqueria Guadelajara or a kebab at Shish Cafe any night of the week for less money)...Sometimes you just want something familiar, though, and if you\\'re considering going to Outback you know what to expect. ..But I might cry a little..Great food, impeccable service, what else could you ask for?..I loved my experience at Blue Point Grille.  I ordered the Nag\\'s head grouper, which was cooked perfectly.  The lobster mashed potatoes that came with it were rich and creamy and even had chunks of lobster in it.  My girlfriend ordered the salmon, which was delicious and came with the BEST RISOTTO THAT I\\'VE EVER TASTED!..Our waiter was very nice and even put my lobster mashed potatoes on a separate plate from my grouper so my (lobster-allergic) girlfriend could have a few bites of my grouper :).Just finished having the most delicious bowl of Taiwanese beef noodle soup. It tastes like nothing I\\'ve had before. I came here based on the Yelp recommendations as I was feeling like having some noodles while in Montreal and I was not disappointed. ..The  restaurant is in a quiet area and is small and cozy. The owner/operator is very nice. The inside of the restaurant has a very homey feeling like you\\'ve been invited to eat at someone\\'s house. We ordered beef noodle soup and Cantonese chow mein. The definite standout was the beef noodle soup. It was so delicious. I\\'ve had similar noodles in Toronto but the broth was the best I\\'ve had. I don\\'t know what their secret recipe is but oh yum yum. We also had the custard filled and red bean filled cakes which were freshly made. They were delicious as well. ..If you\\'re in the area it is definitely worth checking out..It\\'s a filipino store, i get it. But they cant assume everyone speaks or understands tagalog. There are a few nonfilipinos in the store. The cashier took her time opening a line for me. But then was in a rush to check my items out and when she spoke to me.. It was super fast tagalog. I told her to slow down and then maybe ill understand. ..The bakery is cash only. Why? The store and foodcourt accept debit. ..Finally got to try the food court. Went here after church. So around 10:45am. Went to get a few things. Most of the people flock to the back to get fish & meat. There wasnt a line at the foodcourt until 11:00am just in time for lunch. They should put names of the food somewhere..Friendly nice and if you ask to fix something she is sooo nice about it . Wants to make sure it\\'s exactly what you want ..If you like Mandarin and Chinese buffets then this is the place for you.  I\\'m not a huge buffet fan, but if you are looking for variety this place has it. There are tons of items to choose from. The place has most of the items you would expect from a Chinese buffet and more. They have everything from a seafood station, salad station, sushi station, pasta station, meat station, to the dessert station. I was here for the dinner rush on Saturday and it got busy fairly quickly. I suggest making reservations if you go since it gets really busy on the weekend...The thing that I loved the most was the lobster bisque, which was my favourite dish of the night. If you go, this is a must try! The soup was creamy and smooth with a really nice lobster taste. As an added bonus the bisque contained bits of lobster in it. The one suggestion I would have for the restaurant is that people should be able to get the hot food from both sides of the serving trays. There were long lines for some of the hot food stations. Especially the crab. If you enjoy crab and want lots of it this place is a good choice. Spoonful has two different types of crab: one that is seasoned and normal boiled crab. My family loves crab and they really enjoyed it. ..The dessert stations have a huge selection: ice cream, soft serve ice cream, cakes, cup cakes, jello, fruit, waffles, and I loved the candy station which I thought was really neat - who doesn\\'t love jujubes or candy? My inner kid was delighted..this place does not take walk-ins so if you don\\'t have an appointment do not waste your time here.One of the better burgers I\\'ve had. Perfectly greasy, very tasty. The Cajun fries are excellent. Really solid beer selection. The environment is great. Really glad we made this part of our trip..It was not that busy while we were there. I asked for a kids menu and crayons. The waitress says they are out, but should have some next Friday. I\\'m here today, not next Friday. Anyways, eventually 2 crayons are found and a piece of paper which was nice. However, 40 minutes to get our food seemed a bit outrageous. We were told several times our food was next, but food kept coming out that did not go to our table. When we finally received our food, one of the orders was messed up, but we did not dare say anything in fear it would take another 40 minutes to have it fixed. Highly disappointed..One of the interesting things about dining at Fresco is getting a table next to the kitchen. The smell wafting in from metal-lined window connecting it to the dining room was very reminiscent of a gourmet restaurant I once worked in. And from there, you can see the kind of hard work that goes into making truly high-quality food...Fresco focuses on smaller dishes that pack in a lot of unusual and potent flavors, rather than the massive portions of average food that many other restaurants offer. The result is that when you try something like the lamb or the salmon, you can practically taste the care that went into getting that perfect sear on the meat. In addition to those, I particularly recommend the flatbread, as it had a unique blend of vegetables and spices on top that made it unlike anything I\\'ve ever had. I also remember the bread basically being infused with the essence of butter - easily the best restaurant bread that I\\'ve ever eaten...I ultimately ended up choosing four stars because for the gourmet style that Fresco is going for, it is not the best I\\'ve ever eaten. There\\'s not much that makes it stand out; the menu lacks creativity. However, Fresco also offers some of the most affordable prices for food of this caliber that I\\'ve ever seen. Revel in the discount gourmet experience. Going to a restaurant like this in Chicago would cost you three times as much..What a great Asian joint! The service was superb. Our server (Rory) was very attentive, accommodating and knowledgable about the menu/wine list. He had a nice personality and was courteous without being overbearing. ...The food was tremendously better than expected. I ordered a tempura roll, with the chicken teriyaki entree and my boo ordered the hibachi salmon. Both entrees included miso soup (which I don\\'t like in general), but our server was able to give me an extra serving of salad, instead of miso soup. The salad was exceptionally fresh! Although I\\'m a sushi virgin, the tempura roll was delicious ;-)  My teriyaki chicken was fresh and cooked to perfection. The chicken wasn\\'t dry, like most dishes. Although I did not taste the salmon, it looked very appealing! The presentation of the dishes was admirable....I left feeling full, but not heavy...like I usually feel after eating...especially when the good is good. Lol. The food was light, healthy and FRESH!..I will definitely eat here again. Please note, this hidden gym is located inside of the Southpointe Casino..We came here for the vegan menu on 3/15/15 and were very happy with our entire experience. I had the nachos featuring Teese vegan cheese and Gardein faux-chicken. It was luxuriously creamy and very satisfying. ..The mojitos here are the best in the hotel. We tried the mojitos at the Franklin bar in Delano and one at the Border Grill in Mandalay Bay. The one at Hussong\\'s is far superior. Pleasantly just sweet enough and a generous size. We tried the peach and mango mojitos and peach was the best of the two. Highly recommend. ..Lastly our server was excellent. She was very friendly and accommodating..Amazing variety and food service is fast and friendly and the food came out very quickly with GREAT presentation the location is very convenient  as well.New Location with way more space, they have a prep kitchen seating available via reservation if you have parties greater than 5..Ate here 3-27-18 first thing I noticed was the great smell of hickory & the decor inside was cool. Staff was really friendly& the food I had was bomb!!! Had combo 2 ribs mac&cheese & cowboy fries were fantastic! The sweet tea is just perfect not too sweetI will def make the drive from Vegas now & then to eat here!i am a picky bbq eater & this place passed with flying colors!!!!.Burger was awesome. However, I went to use the restroom and when I pushed the door open, the door was so sticky my hand got stuck on it.  ..Don\\'t get me wrong, the food was awesome..I waited for 25 minutes on a day I would expect to have a full staff. I waited for an hour and a half for order, which is unaccetable. But nah they came pretty fast . U good, szeen.Love the place, dark yet character. Food was great the beer was nice and cold..  Will come back. When I visit....You should by no means go out of your way to visit the Treasure Island Buffet, however IF you are already here and don\\'t feel like going to another resort or you got one of the 2 for 1 coupons they give hotel guests, then it\\'s not all that bad...The buffet does have it\\'s highlights: the lobster ravioli from the pasta station is very good, the pizza is decadently cheesy and tasty, and the cupcakes are downright delicious, especially the red velvet cupcakes.  PRO TIP: grab an extra cupcake at the end of your visit and pretend like you are eating it on your way out, then save it for later...Honestly, there isn\\'t anything terrible about the buffet, but I can understand how those paying full price feel like they can do better as the selection does feel limited compared to other buffets.  Our server was outstanding, even if all he did was get us drinks..This place is very unique ! ..Small inside not many seats . But....it\\'s okay since the treats are so good . I got a \"smore eh ohh \"..The wife got fluffenutter ! ..Both very good . We will be back for sure ! ..Worth every penny ! ..It\\'s a Friday night and it\\'s not packed !!! But there is a line !.Been going here for it has to be close to ten years now. Typically when my husband and I go we always order so much food and we eat it all happily! Lol. Our fav thing is their spring rolls with peanut sauce. I could eat several orders and have that been my meal. I\\'m also a fan of the spicy green beans, papaya salad, and banh xeo. They are the only place I\\'ve found the crab and shrimp soup my mom used to make. .Service is always great and friendly. You might have to wait for a table. But it\\'s worth it..Honest, sincere and sophisticated service is what i always receive at ToyoMotors. Thank you guys for being so remarkable!!!.Soooo good love their salsa lo e their enchiladas. Great prices. So glad we found this place!!.I STILL come to this place ALL the time to get my nails done. It\\'s wonderful. Now that my favorite - Ashley - is on maternity leave, I go to her husband Jimmy. I highly recommend him for acrylics/fills and reg manis, as well! Just got my nails filled today and got a pretty glittery red for the holidays and my fill was 20. Not too shabby :).Yes Melissa totally redeemed my last trip here...   I came back for the good and now the service reflects what I ate.  Melissa good job dealing with my PIA friend who was out of line for something so petty.  (That was not a test she just has no manners). I had a crab cake Benedict, my friend had the frittata and momma Lia had the Biloxi friend chicken sand.  Bottomless blood orange mimosas to counteract my obnoxious friend made it A++++.  My Benny was so delicious that I wanted to lick the plate and I am not really a hollandaise fan.  If you are looking for a cool place to eat with a show stopping menu and casual/fine fine service come here and ask for Melissa..This is the best Indian-Nepali restaurant in las vegas i have ever been....i tried both veg and non veg items...both were delicious....momo and sekuwaa was the best part....Ron is amazing!  I went in for a hamstring strain while training for a full marathon. He was highly recommended by many runners. He was very informative and answered all my questions. He did an evaluation of me and recorded my running on the treadmill. Suggested a slight correction in my running form and a few days later my 18 mile long run went off without a hitch!  I would most definitely recommend Ron even if you don\\'t have an injury he can help you with strength and form and just become an overall better runner. I\\'m so glad I went in!.Obviously I\\'m one of the few who likes this place, but I just judge it for it is.  I don\\'t come here expecting authentic Mexican food or a fine dining experience.  I do come here for tasty margaritas and the poblano chicken dinner, which is the only food I\\'ve ever ordered from here.  It\\'s a chicken and cheese stuffed poblano pepper, breaded and fried and covered with their bajai sauce.  Now I know the bajai sauce is nothing more than cream (sour cream?), cream cheese and jalapeno juice, but it sure is yummy!  Quite addictive and no way it\\'s good for you, but I just can\\'t help myself.  The chips and salsa they serve when you sit down are good, they offer a mild and a hotter sauce and I like them both just fine...I love the patio they have overlooking a small \"lake\".  It\\'s a great place to hang out and drink margarita\\'s.  I have always had good service here...I\\'ve been here many times over the years and I\\'m sure I\\'ll be back again!.Stay away. Showered the big tall hotness with dollars just to get hit in the balls when her boyfriend picked up the money..Great place to have a beer. Servers say that the beer selection is gluten free friendly. Brewmaster wife a celiac so he knows the struggle. .Tasty beers, nice atmosphere, lovely staff. Stop by if you\\'re in the south end area.When calling to schedule an appointment, I told them that my carpet would need to be treated for pet stains. They told me that I could save some money by going to Petsmart and purchasing Natures Miracle pet stain remover. I really appreciated that they told me this to save me some money. Karl was the technician who came out to the house and he was an extremely nice guy. I expected him to try and up sell but he did not. He did a great job on my very old and worn out carpet. I would recommend them to anyone. In addition, they are priced very reasonably and gave me a 10 percent discount..So I went to get my oil changed on both of my vehicles before my c section Monday and I was completely blown away at how amazing Justin Rubin and his team of mechanics were. They were quick and attentive to my concerns and answered all of my questions in laymen\\'s terms for me. PLUS, Justin noticed that I had another issue that needed to be fixed pronto so he went above and beyond to help me fix my broken torque strut at no additional cost to me. These are a team of men that love what they do and use their skills in a very cost effective, honest and quick way. I will definitely be going back to them for all of my maintenance needs. If you are looking for a mechanic that takes pride in his workmanship and is a fair and honest businessman; then Justin Rubino would be your man! Thanks guys for all your hard work!.Love the food!! It\\'s so fresh and reasonably priced.  Able to accommodate a larger group and strollers..Although normally good food, the service has been less than par that past several times. Recently we had reservations for 7pm in the Hibachi room for 20 people. The waitress took drink orders, but when the drinks arrived, my order and other guest did not get our order. I had to ask twice, and was told by the waitress that she busy and only had two hands, pointing to the soup she was carrying. At 7:15 almost all of the guests had arrived but we were missing a few, so we got started with ordering rolls. We were then told we had to get our main orders in and to be done by 8:30 as the room was reserved for another party. So we did. We end up at Takumi until 9pm, no other party arrived. We choose 7pm since in the past that was the last reservation of the evening for the room, so we knew there wasn\\'t going to be another party after us. Why lie to us? With our orders, my husband and I wanted steamed rice instead of fried rice. When the rice didn\\'t arrive for us and the rest of the group started eating their fried rice I asked the hibachi chef and then the waitress for our steamed rice, ok, ok was the answer but they ever brought it. The rest of my food was getting cold so we ate our \"meat and veggies\" without. When the waitress came around to take dessert orders, I asked again about the rice. She asked it we still wanted it. Really? After all the meat and veggies were gone. Then to top it all off, when one of the latecomers ordered his food it came straight from the kitchen, no time for the hibachi chef to cook it live, which was fine, but he ended up with food poisoning. Next time we want hibachi, we will definitely look elsewhere..Full disclosure - I have never eaten here.  But if you want to come for a good old fashioned cocktail lounge, then this is hard to beat.  Hasn\\'t changed in 20+ years since I was last here except the old TV\\'s are now flat screens.  The TV\\'s are located above the bubbling water fire pit (yep, still there after all this time) but small enough to be private screens showing old music video clips.  Think MTV before it become a TV Channel.  Sorry about the lack of 5th star but they really do need to know how to make an espresso martini and not try and fudge it.  Other than that a great late night stop off for after dinner drinks..The in-laws used some timeshare points for a week stay here. We got two sides, a larger and smaller side. While I\\'m used to having more things to do in a resort setting, the jacuzzi was nice sized, as was the pool. But a basketball hoop in the pool wouldn\\'t be a bad addition. Heck there\\'s enough room for it...Room cleanliness was not an issue and the kitchen had a enough to get by for a while. However, they supplied metal kitchen utensils for cooking (i.e. Spatulas, etc.) which detrimentally affects pots and pans. I think the non-stick on our pan was shoddy because of this...My wife had one consistent complaint: the pillows were iffy. Your head sinks straight away and offers little support...If I had a chance to do this again, I\\'d probably rather stay at the Kierland resort instead..Good food for Medina! Chef and owner John keeps it consistent and service is decent!  Sit down stairs for both menus upstairs fine dining only!.Cheaper than many local competitors, although still more expensive than online stores for some items, Cabela\\'s remains my go to store for most shooting accessories.  They usually have a great selection of name brand ammunition for reasonable prices.  ..The staff has always been friendly and helpful..La seule pouting que j\\'ai mangé au Canada ! Ce n\\'est pas mon plat préféré mais celle que j\\'ai mangé était très copieuse pour la petite taille et excellente. Possible de manger dehors mais pas d\\'y boire de l\\'alcool. Serveuses sympathiques, prix bas..Southwest bowl is the bomb! Fresh food. Nice service.  Truly Delish!.However, they need more indoor seating space and extended hours..I stopped in there and showed Cami my nails.... Had been to another salon to have my nails done. She was absolutely wonderful she looked at my nails and told me I probably needed to go to the Dr. my nails were lifting! They were really bad! I thought I could have them done and she told me \" NO\". I really appreciated her being honest with me! Thanks Cami! When my nails get better I will be back!.As the epicenter of the Strip keeps migrating north, the MGM Grand in general just doesn\\'t seem to have the pull it once did.  I feel the same way about Craftsteak.  This was probably amazing in 2002 when it opened........but, I think the more recent hotels on the Strip learned from the MGM and really raised the bar.  The steaks at Craftsteak were good, but the overall environment, experience, and location just can\\'t compete with the likes of Prime, the SW steakhouse, Botero, the Eiffel Tower restaurant, etc...The tables near the entrance felt like eating in a mall.  Just didn\\'t work for me..Happiness that you can purchase in a paper cup (or waffle bowl)..They have Red velvet, chocolate, birthday cake...+ Toppings galore...Menchies seems to be expanding with new locations popping up all over the place...Just in time for summer!  And this location has a large front window that opens up to the street.  ..The service here is friendly, there\\'s always a steady stream of customers..I might have to start walking on the other side of the street to cut down on fro-yo intake...I heart Menchie\\'s!.  =D.The best southern food around. I go to school across the street and I have finally found a place that is delicious and affordable. You get a lot for your money. I got the BBQ chicken, cabbage, collard greens and cornbread with a sweet tea for $9. The cornbread was moist and everything was delicious. The restaurant is very clean and the customer service is superb. Highly recommend this place.  see you guys soon for lunch..I waited in the lobby for about 45 minutes before going to see Dr Shafer.  He was a complete jerk from the minute he walked in the room.  I already knew my problem was tendonitis of my shoulder caused by lifting my 9 month old daughter.  He repeatedly told me I need to change the things Im doing at home that are causing the pain.  I explained I cannot change that I have no help with my daughter and can\\'t change the fact that I need to lift her all day every day.  He gave me a steroid injection and told me it will work in 2-3 weeks.  I asked for pain medication to get me through until then and he firmly replied \"absolutely NOT\" before I had even finished my sentence.  I told him I need some relief because I can\\'t care for my daughter in this much pain.  He said \"there are too many side effects in pain medications.\"  Well I\\'ve been an ER nurse for the last 15 years and I think I know the side effects.  If the medication is taken properly there shouldn\\'t be side effects.  This is NO REASON to leave me so miserable in pain.  I just delivered a baby 9 mos ago and only took Ibuprofen after.  I am hurting and he didn\\'t give a crap.  He abruptly left the room and left me bawling.  I had to go to urgent care later that day to get a prescription.  .I work in the ER and people come in all day needing pain relief.  As long as a person doesn\\'t have repeated visits we NEVER decline a patient pain relief.  This BRIAN SHAFER guy has no compassion and should not be a health care provider.  .For the record I have never complained on Yelp.  I was so insulted and disgusted by this jerk I thought I should share my experience.***4.5 Stars ***..I planned my SO\\'s birthday surprise here this past weekend.  We all had a blast.  Awtash Cafe has online reservations for big groups.  We were able to get a cozy corner booth.  I love the vibe at this place, so laidback and there is awesome lounge/techno music playing in the background...We had tried their 5 dip platter, which was delicious.  It came with all the middle eastern dip fare, hummus, baba ganosh (sp?), marinated olives and some warm persian flat bread.  Their drinks were reasonably priced, a pitcher of Sangaria for $16!  We even did a round of shots at $6 each...The main draw to Awtash was the Hookah bar!  You can get two flavours for $15, it comes with 2 coals.  I did not realize how relaxing Hookah was, it was a great pairing with our drinks...The service did match the vibe at this place.  It was very chilled out and they would periodically check in with you if you need anything.  Do not expect rush and prompt service if that is what you are looking for...I will definitely be back for future loungey nights out..This is my back up butcher, the one great product they carry is their seaweed fed lamb from the Gaspe, other than that they don\\'t carry anything out of the ordinary, chicken, beef and pork are pretty standard. I was disappointed when I asked them for skinless/boneless chicken thighs, they said they couldn\\'t do it. Are you serious? You are a butcher, this is what you do, you butcher. Big turnoff. Like I said it is a back up to the place that gets all their animals directly from local farmers..I want to cry, it was so good...I came here for the specific purpose of trying out chicken and waffles. To be honest, I don\\'t \"get\" what the big deal is with this combination. Next time, I\\'ll just get the chicken meal with a couple bowls of their greens and macaroni. See what I mean? Haven\\'t digested my meal and I\\'m already planning out my next visit. I\\'m lucky I live far away from Carmi\\'s, or the south in general, otherwise I\\'d weigh a million pounds. ..Pros: The food is the real deal. Excellent soul food at reasonable prices, made to order. And they\\'re honest about their shortcomings, like telling us there will be about a 20 minute wait for the food to cook, or that there\\'s a 0.25 fee for using cards, which is reasonable...Cons: Come on, guys. You\\'re getting rave reviews, you\\'re in a cute neighborhood. Put some new booths in there, put some paint on the walls, some new lighting fixtures. Also, the staff is friendly and well-meaning but awkward. That\\'s just something that comes with training and time..MY GOD IS THIS PLACE LOUD! ..Upon leaving the restaurant my throat felt as if I\\'ve been trying to win a debate battle at a nightclub for the past hour...But then....Undeniably delicious mushroom pasta (don\\'t look for the name here, literally everyone on this page is talking about it, I\\'m sure you\\'ve seen it)...Best kale salad I\\'ve ever had with these yummy currant pieces...$1/oz house wines!..Plus a charming bartender/server...I...will definitely consider coming back..This is not the place to go for Mediterranean food..The gyros were awful. The hummus was so disgusting. The person in front of me ordered one of their chicken plates... They put the chicken on the grill for less then two mins.. Which means it had to be precooked.. And they pull out a cold pita out of a container bin. I can say I am not impressed with the quality it can\\'t even be compared to a chipotle.. It\\'s that awful....I went to DeWitt\\'s based solely on his rave reviews.  I had never met Evan or stepped foot in his store, so it was a leap of faith.  And let me say Evan delivered the most gorgeous ring I could ever have imagined.  I had several pieces of jewelry I was no longer wearing and I decided to combine them all into a custom made ring.  Evan is an artist and designing that one-of-a-kind piece is what he does best!  I had an idea what I wanted, and I brought to him some ideas I had and, together with his knowledge and understanding, he created a show stopper!  He communicated throughout the entire process so I always knew what stage the design was in. He knew just what I had in mind and he delivered.  I couldn\\'t be happier!  Thanks again, Evan!.Found this gem at a farmers market in Summerlin.  Wonderful flavor that milk, cream, and sugar are not needed.  I am looking more from them in the future..The first time we were there the service was awesome, the owner was working behind the bar and he really takes care of you and tends the bar well. We never had to ask for a drink and he recommended some great beers. On our second visit we were quite disappointed,  it took way too long to even get a knowledged and i played $100 dollars on the machine before i got my first beer, the guy next to me got smart and just ordered two at a time because they were taking so long granted the bar was kind of busy but the bartenders didnt have any urgency. I like this place and ill give it another shot just because its something diff since we are always going to redrock but ill def only be staying if i see the right people working..Good Wisconsin Pub fare. Prices are reasonable.  Daughter enjoyed prime rib.  Place can get very noisy at lunch time..Food - 3.8.Service 5.Total stars 4..Ok so the food pre meets the expectations of the photos i viewed prior to dining here tonight. The fries were so good that I honestly wasn\\'t as hungry once my burger arrived, but I still cut that sucker in half and did my best to eat every bit. I ordered the mac n cheese burger with a special request of pastrami on it. Figured I switch it up a bit and I was happy to do so. Our server was name Nick and he was FANTASTIC. Superb service for a burger joint. He made our experience that much better due to his patience and willingness to help us find the entrees we were in the mood for and we appreciate that. ..So for recommendations, here our suggestions...Truffle fries (be carefully as the portion is super large)..Pepperoni sticks (personally liked the dip more than the sticks but the wife liked them)..Chicken wings (good and fancy not mind blowing)..Mac n cheese (overrated in my opinion or more like the outback of steakhouses kind of burger) if you like outback, you\\'ll likely like this burger..Fantastic team of professional people devoted to their clients! I highly recommend their service..I got racing stripes and a strip down the hood on my Corvette. I wanted the vinyl to be similar to the Carbon black flash metallic paint that was on my Corvette vents. That is why this is a 2 star and not 1 star. The vinyl was a close match.  My husband picked up the car and  I came home 2 days later expecting for it to be good quality work. I was wrong. I immediately noticed the stretch marks and creases. I went down to team acme and was told it needed more time in the heat. I have had vinyl done on several other cars and expressed this and knew heat was not going to fix this. However they stated it needed more time. It has now been 2 weeks and it looks the same. There are stretched creases in the hood. In addition the hash marks  do not follow the wheel well line went over in some parts and under in some. The hash marks look good from 15 ft away but I did not pay for looking good 15 feet away. I am so disappointed and will not have them place vinyl on any other vehicle and now I will be removing the stripes. If you were aware that you did not have enough vinyl or the work was not good you should of removed it and not charged me $350 until the work was good..I have never had a problem with this location since I started coming here about four months ago. Their lines always pass quickly so I\\'ve never had much of a long wait, and my food is always presented exactly as I requested with good temperature. I usually order online and simply pick up my food for the sake of convenience. I work nearby and it\\'s always ready for me to pick up by the time I get there (only a few minutes after ordering online.) ..I ordered online today and got there before the food was done, so I had to wait about 5-10 minutes. The staff was friendly and even gave me a coupon for the inconvenience! I will definitely continue to go here for lunch or dinner..I went to Sun West Nails for the first time and was very pleased.  I saw Tracy who was very friendly and eager to please.  I received a great Mani and Pedi and was more than satisfied!  I will be returning!.This is the best a la carte Brazilian restaurant I know of in Toronto. The menu has a good selection, the art on the wall is great and give the restaurant a good atmosphere. The desert selection is ok and the coffee is also good. I go there often with my wife..Came here for restaurant week and am very disappointed in the service and food. Very slow service, inconsistent quality of food, and watered down drinks. Do not recommend this place when there are so many awesome places in Charlotte..I was so excited to try this place as I had seen the reviews and it sounded great!..I ordered the grilled chicken family pack. The chicken was really good. It was moist and tasty. I got two sides with the family pack. Campero beans and corn salad. The corn salad was fair and the beans were good but the container of beans was maybe 1/2 full. The issue I have is the cost of the two sides. $7.00 for two sides - especially when one was only 1/2 full!..I may go back for the chicken but I won\\'t get the sides again!.We stopped by on Sunday after doing some furniture shopping near by.  After being told by so many people that there is no good BBQ in Charlotte, we were VERY happy to stumble upon Bobbee\\'s.  ..The place is tiny and can get hot, but I it\\'s really clean so we stayed and ate there.  ..The woman at the counter (Rashina?) was so kind.  We told her we\\'d just moved to NC and that this was our first BBQ.  She gave us both some of the pork and brisket to try.  I rarely eat pork, but this was so tender and had that vinegary sauce, simply delicious.  ..My husband and I each order dinner platter (even though it was lunch time) because we wanted to try as many items as possible...I make my own brisket and have high standards which Bobbee O\\'s exceeded! That meat was ridiculously tender and beautifully caramelized.  My only disappointment is that it was fatty.  I\\'ll ask next time if they can give me leaner cuts.  However, I rarely eat meat and when I do there has to be no gristle and no fat, etc.  So I\\'m a bit extreme.  Others would love this flavorful meat.  As another reviewer said, the fat just melts in your mouth.  ..We both had the pulled chicken, which was also moist and absent of any fat or gristle you sometimes find in pulled meat products. My husband had the ribs and they too were tender, caramelized and delicious...My favorite side was the mac & cheese.  So often restaurants serve the bland Kraft mac & cheese like dish.  Not Bobbee O\\'s, their was packed with cheddar flavor.  Beautiful!..The restaurant is not that close to our home, but we will definitely trek out there next time we have a hankering..This was my third visit and was the worst and has forced me to reconsider ever visiting Toby Keith\\'s in Mesa. The wife and I walked in on a Sunday afternoon (slow, I understand that) and the sign said, please wait to be seated. We waited, and waited, and waited. I bartender on the other side of the bar finally realized someone had walked in and asked if we wanted a table or sit at the full service bar. We said we wanted a table. He then hunts for a waitress who asked us \"did you just want to sit at the bar?\" What a great attitude she had! Finally we are seated at the corner of the restaurant...I didn\\'t time it, but both of us read through the menu, took our time to decide what we wanted, then read over the announcement cards and whatever else was on the table. After that time had passed, not one person came over to take a drink order. We noticed the one waitress stop another waitress and ask if we were her table. The second one said no and both of them continued on their way. We continued to wait for a few more minutes and looked around the restaurant. There was only two other booths occupied. Was was a family of three and the other consisted of two employee of the restaurant and a manager with a laptop in front of them...We sat there and discussed the fact that this is a huge bar with hardly any customers in it. Wouldn\\'t you think that you\\'d have a server that much faster because their job is based on tips? I mean seriously! I\\'ve been in a similar industry and understand how operations work and this was pitiful. We both agreed that we\\'ve had enough and were so hungry we couldn\\'t wait. We got up and walked out casually and not one employee of this restaurant said anything to us not even notice we were leaving. So pathetic!!!..The only thing keeping me from leaving 1 star is the fact that this was not my only visit. With that said, my other two visits only brought my 1 star to 2. Think about it....The plates are big and a lot of food, I would go there again. It looks remodeled inside. The waiters and waitresses  are nice also..Let me start by saying that I think trying to get downtown going is a great thing.  I live down here but I hate how spread out this city is.  True downtown is walkable and the light rail helps but much of the best venues are spread out around the outskirts.  Cityscape to me looks like a medical office park.  In a city (well, the general area) with so much innovative and/or very pleasant design, this is a dud.  I predict a full face lift of  this property within five years which is sad for something at this cost level.  Not inviting and not something that was well thought out.  It comes off like something that got caught up in red tape and the left hand wasn\\'t working with the right hand.  Nothing is here yet that you can\\'t get elsewhere with free parking and lower sales tax rates.  Perhaps the new restaurants will make it worth going to.  .A note on the ice skating.  The website says it can accommodate 75-100 skaters.  I would estimate the rink is 50x50 at most (most likely 40x40), so that would not be a comfortable time on the ice if they were at \"capacity.\"  Aside from that, they didn\\'t have skates smaller than kids size 9 so our daughter got all excited and couldn\\'t skate.  I tried calling ahead of time but it just has a recording and says to check the website.  What is the point of even having the number?  It was just another thing that wasn\\'t well thought out or executed about CityScape..Food is interesting, but good. Love the atmosphere and the staff. Great place to relax and enjoy something different..Mmmm dosa... I went to guru lukshmi with my friend around 6pm and it was pretty packed.  We got the tomato dosa with aloo masala, dahi vada (lentil donuts in yogurt), and the vegetable spring masala dosa. SOOOOOO GOOD. Everything we ate was exploding with flavour and spices. The dahi vada was very interesting and tasty, very savoury with the herb infused yogurt and donut combination. The dosa is HUGE. You\\'ll definitely be full after one order! The tomato dosa was delicious with all the different sauces to enjoy it with. The spring dosa was also really really good. Definitely recommend checking this place out if you\\'re in the area (or not, it\\'s worth the trek to come down to try this place out!) prices were quite reasonable as well for the amount of food you\\'re being served..Organized a surprise party including 40 invitees.  Williams staff were courteous and efficient and the food was excellent.  Williams was the perfect venue to celebrate the milestone birthday for my wife and I recommend them for any other event you are planning.  Thank you Williams for doing such a superb job..Frank gave me an amazing haircut! I had dry, damaged hair from going blonde in the past (my hair is almost black naturally) and Frank gave me the chop I was afraid of for so long-- a blunt lob! it looks amazing and I am still loving it even after the newness wore off! ..I was getting frequent trims for the last year trying to avoid getting a major cut because I wanted to grow my hair out long like it used to be. I went in for a consultation and shared my past hair experiences as well as my problem areas. My hair was all different lengths, breaking, split, dry-- just awful! ..I wanted a blunt cut that was all the same length, but I was nervous before the consultation because every time I had gotten my haircut in the past, stylists would add layers. I would hate it! I once cried after a short haircut. This time,  I walked out of the salon with the best haircut I\\'ve ever had. He listened to exactly what I wanted and made me look better than I expected! ..Now my hair feels healthy, full-- I barely recognize its integrity! I finally feel like it will actually grow back nicely again, and who knows, I may even keep this style permanently! No more split ends, no more dryness, no more breakage! I am SO pleased and will definitely be returning for another haircut with Frank!.Not what I expected, Better. A wide selection of toys LeLo and the like with tons of lingerie and shoes! Body glitter and bindi; fun fun fun. Reasonable prices. The outside is plain and does not do justice to what they offer inside...Think 50 Shades meets Victoria\\'s Secret. Yes they have movies and magazines but their selection of books (instructional) and body lotions, potions, creams and lube is larger than their movie collection...What I was not expecting was their selection of gag gifts! Too much fun!!..Deff worth a shopping trip. They do parties and I just might have to invite the girls out for a great night..I used to eat here all the time when the place was on Springfield and Champaign but the new place in Urbana does not taste the same It has no flavor no seasoning and very slow service And the salsa taste like spaghetti sauce and they don\\'t have their homemade red hot sauce.Broth was very sweet to me and I didn\\'t find nothing special about this place... sorry, but I will choose to go to other restaurant next time....I dare you to find a best value for amazing pastries in the greater Cleveland area. Michael\\'s bakery is more than worth the drive if you don\\'t live close by (like I don\\'t). Their pastries are delicious, fresh as it can be and with the perfect balance of sweetness and texture, you could absolutely find them in any European patisserie. An absolute hidden gem!.Stopped in for a quick Honey Bar treat. Because this was my first visit I had a few questions. The Caucasian woman behind the counter who was also preparing salads and fruit cups, sounded bothered by the three inquiries. I noticed I placed the order at the kiosk twice so I deleted the extra order. The system didn\\'t print a receipt. As I was called up two bowls were waiting. After being questioned about the order one bowl was removed from the bag. No biggie as I didn\\'t need or plan to pay for two. The bowl was covered with yogurt. So much so that my bag was icky. The price point alone should be an indication of the level of quality one should expect. After wipping off the bowl and cleaning my sticky hands, I was able to finally enjoy my evening snack. .May consider coming again.Classy Nails is the best nail salon around!  Rose the owner does eye lash extensions and she is by far the best around!!  They look beautiful and natural!  Her prices are very reasonable!!  I keep her cards with me because I am constantly being asked about my lashes!!  If it\\'s nails you need look no further... Henry is Amazing!!! He is very detailed in his work and my gel nails always come out perfect!!!!  This nail salon has a beautiful and classy decor and Amy at the desk is so sweet and welcoming!.Will not be going back! Brought my daughter in and he doc spent less than 5 min with her. She previously had a fever and was wheezing. Doc said the noise was coming from her nose and said she had allergies. She ended up with another fever and I was in a different urgent care less than 24 hours later where she was diagnosed with bronchiolitis. Waste of my time and my $50 copay!.I went in for the first check up to my new puppy, thinking this place is gonna be my new vet for my dog, I talked with a doctor and asked him questions about my puppy, his answers did not make sense and I left and did research behind my questions and his answers, and found out the doctor was lying to me, I don\\'t trust a lying doctor, so they won\\'t see me again..I\\'ve ordered from here on Uber eats a couple times & they don\\'t ever seem to take their delivery customers seriously. I\\'ve had a few occasions where I\\'ve made a certain request to add a certain vegetable to my curry and they don\\'t listen, or they don\\'t put the sauces that belongs with my appetizer. I\\'ve had missing Togo forks n knives it\\'s just very annoying when they don\\'t value returning or first time customers!!!!.Finallly got the try this place out after I spotted it being constructed last time out in Vegas. ..Be prepared to wait, especially if you have a large party. This place is always packed and even though I was eating by myself, I still had to wait about 30 minutes. They do have a cool texting service though that will let you know through text when you\\'re reservation is ready. AND not to mention that you can easily go shopping as well when waiting or gambling since there are tables and slots right outside of the restaurant...Decided to order the Hell\\'s kitchen burger with Truffle parmesian fries. The burger and fries looked fantastic and you could tell that they really put a lot of pride in their food based on the appearance of the food. The burger was very juicy, cooked medium rare just the way I like it! Contrary to what others say, this burger is not that spicy at all. It also does have a nice sweet taste which went with the mild spiciness of the burger. All ingredients were very fresh and the burger was great! ..The fries were the the highlight of the night! The fries are humongous and easily shareable with two people. The parmesian went great with the fries and all of the seasonings on the fries provided a great touch. They weren\\'t too crispy and weren\\'t too soft; I highly recommend trying them out...This place is pretty pricey though as getting a burger and fries could easily run you 30-35 bucks. SHARE the fries as it is definitely enough to share between a couple of people. Good stuff and great location real close to the miracle mile shops and planet hollywood.'"

      "Statistical Tests for Optimization Efficiency..Levi Boyles, Anoop Korattikara, Deva Ramanan, Max Welling.Department of Computer Science.University of California, Irvine.Irvine, CA 92697-3425.{lboyles},{akoratti},{dramanan},{welling}@ics.uci.edu..Abstract.Learning problems, such as logistic regression, are typically formulated as pure.optimization problems defined on some loss function. We argue that this view.ignores the fact that the loss function depends on stochastically generated data.which in turn determines an intrinsic scale of precision for statistical estimation..By considering the statistical properties of the update variables used during the.optimization (e.g. gradients), we can construct frequentist hypothesis tests to.determine the reliability of these updates. We utilize subsets of the data for computing updates, and use the hypothesis tests for determining when the batch-size.needs to be increased. This provides computational benefits and avoids overfitting.by stopping when the batch-size has become equal to size of the full dataset..Moreover, the proposed algorithms depend on a single interpretable parameter?.the probability for an update to be in the wrong direction? which is set to a single.value across all algorithms and datasets. In this paper, we illustrate these ideas.on three L1 regularized coordinate descent algorithms: L1 -regularized L2 -loss.SVMs, L1 -regularized logistic regression, and the Lasso, but we emphasize that.the underlying methods are much more generally applicable...1..Introduction..There is an increasing tendency to consider machine learning as a problem in optimization: define.a loss function, add constraints and/or regularizers and formulate it as a preferably convex program..Then, solve this program using some of the impressive tools from the optimization literature. The.main purpose of this paper is to point out that this?reduction to optimization? ignores certain.important statistical features that are unique to statistical estimation. The most important feature.we will exploit is the fact that the statistical properties of an estimation problem determine an.intrinsic scale of precision (that is usually much larger than machine precision). This implies.immediately that optimizing parameter-values beyond that scale is pointless and may even have an.adverse affect on generalization when the underlying model is complex. Besides a natural stopping.criterion it also leads to much faster optimization. We will use the following methods to evaluate the.optimization.
